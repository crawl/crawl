1. CTAGS-EXUBERANT SETTINGS FOR CRAWL

For users of ctags-exuberant, there are some settings that can improve
your quality of living when working on crawl. Note that some of these
settings aren't appropriate for your ~/.ctags unless you work exclusively
on crawl.

--langdef=crawlmap
--langmap=crawlmap:+.des
--regex-crawlmap=/^ *NAME: *([^ ]*)/\1/q,map,map definition/

    Create tags for maps in .des files, pointing to the NAME: line.
    Single-quote the regex in the shell, but not in .ctags.

--regex-c++=/^ *DEF_BITFIELD *\( *([a-zA-Z0-9_:]*)/\1/t/

    Treat the DEF_BITFIELD macro as a typedef.

-I decltype+

    More correctly interpret "auto func() -> decltype(foo)" as a declaration
    of "func", not of "decltype".

--extra=+q

    Allow searching for "player::rot", not just "rot".

--exclude=contrib
--exclude=android-project
--exclude=saves

    Don't tag third-party code, and don't try to tag save files,
    which would otherwise be mistaken for C# source.


2. RUNNING CTAGS AUTOMATICALLY

I like to run ctags automatically every time I take a git action, but don't
want to wait for it to complete each time. Instead, I run ctags in the
background. But, until ctags does finish, I'd rather have an outdated tag
file than an incomplete one; so I have ctags write the tag file to a temporary
location (containing the job's PID to avoid conflicts) then move it into
place once it is ready.

Create an executable script .git/hooks/ctags with the contents:

   #! /bin/sh -e
   cd crawl-ref/source
   tagfile=../../.git/tags.tmp.$$
   ctags -R -f "$tagfile"  # Perhaps add some command-line options here
   mv "$tagfile" tags

Add to your post-checkout, post-commit, and post-merge hooks the line:

   .git/hooks/ctags >/dev/null 2>&1 &

Add to your post-rewrite hook:

   [ "$1" = rebase ] && .git/hooks/ctags >/dev/null 2>&1 &
