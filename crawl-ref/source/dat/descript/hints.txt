welcome

<white>Welcome to Dungeon Crawl!</white>

Your objective is to lead a <w>{{ return you.race() }} {{ return you.class()
}}</w> safely through the depths of the dungeon, retrieving the fabled Orb of
Zot and returning it to the surface. In the beginning, however, let discovery
be your main goal. Try to delve as deeply as possible but beware; death lurks
around every corner.

For the moment, just remember the following keys and their functions:
  <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input> - shows the items and the commands
  <input>$cmd[CMD_SAVE_GAME]</input>  - saves the game, to be resumed later
(but note that death is permanent)
  <input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</input>  - examines something in your vicinity

The hint mode will help you play Crawl without reading any documentation. If
you haven't yet, you might want to try out the tutorial. Also, if you feel
intrigued, there is more information available in the following files from the
docs/ directory (all of which can also be read in-game):
  <lightblue>quickstart.txt</lightblue>     - A very short guide to Crawl.
  <lightblue>crawl_manual.txt</lightblue>   - This contains all details on
species, magic, skills, etc.
  <lightblue>options_guide.txt</lightblue>  - Crawl's interface is highly
configurable. This document explains all the options.

Happy Crawling!

death

Condolences! Your character's premature death is a sad, but common occurrence
in Crawl. Rest assured that with diligence and playing experience your
characters will last longer.

Perhaps the following advice can improve your playing style:
%%%%
death conjurer melee

As a Conjurer your main weapon should be offensive magic. Cast spells more
often! Remember to rest when your Magic is low.
%%%%
death berserker unberserked

Don't forget to go berserk when fighting particularly difficult foes. It's
risky, but makes you faster and beefier.
{{
    if you.hunger() < 3 then
        return "Berserking is impossible while very hungry or worse, so " ..
               "make sure to stay fed at all times, just in case you need " ..
               "to berserk."
    end
}}
%%%%
death ranger melee

Your bow and arrows are extremely powerful against distant monsters. Be sure to
collect all arrows lying around in the dungeon.
%%%%
death random 0

Always consider using projectiles, wands or spells before engaging monsters in
close combat.
%%%%
death random 1

Learn when to run away from things you can't handle — this is important! It is
often wise to skip a particularly dangerous level. But don't overdo this as
monsters will only get harder the deeper you delve.
%%%%
death random 2

Rest between encounters, if possible in an area already explored and cleared of
monsters. Pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles>, or
<input>clicking into the stat area</input></localtiles> will let you rest for a
moment (you will stop resting after 100 turns, or when fully healed).
%%%%
death random 3

Remember to use those scrolls, potions or wands you've found. Very often, you
cannot expect to identify everything with the scroll only. Learn to improvise:
identify through usage.
%%%%
death random 4

If a particular encounter feels overwhelming don't forget to use emergency
items early on. A scroll of teleportation or a potion of speed can really save
your bacon.
%%%%
death random 5

Never fight more than one monster, if you can help it. Always back into a
corridor so that they are forced to fight you one on one.
%%%%
finished

Congrats! You survived until the end of the hint mode — be sure to try the
other ones as well. Note that the command help screen
(<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input>) will look very different from now
on. Here's a last playing hint:
%%%%
finished explored

Walking around and exploring levels gets easier by using auto-explore
(<input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input>). Crawl will let you automatically move to
and pick up interesting items.<localtiles>

Autoexploration can also be started by <input>Ctrl-Leftclick</input> on the
minimap.</localtiles>
%%%%
finished travel

There is a convenient way for travelling between far away dungeon levels: press
<input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]</input> and enter the desired destination.
If your travel gets interrupted, issuing <input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]
Enter</input> will continue it.
%%%%
finished stashes

You can search among all items existing in the dungeon with the
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> command. For example,
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> <w>"dagger"</w> will list all daggers.
You can then travel to one of the spots. It is even possible to enter words
like <w>"shop"</w> or <w>"altar"</w>.
%%%%
finished random 0

The game keeps an automated logbook for your characters. Use
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]:</input> to read it. You can enter notes
manually with the <input>$cmd[CMD_MAKE_NOTE]</input> command. Once your
character perishes, two morgue files are left in the <w>morgue/</w> directory.
The one ending in .txt contains a copy of your logbook. During play, you can
create a dump file with <input>$cmd[CMD_CHARACTER_DUMP]</input>.
%%%%
finished random 1

Crawl has a macro function built in: press <input>~m</input> to define a macro
by first specifying a trigger key (say, <input>F1</input>) and a command
sequence, for example <input>za+.</input>. The latter will make the
<input>F1</input> key always zap the spell in slot a at the nearest monster.
For more information on macros, type
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]~</input>.
%%%%
finished random 2

The interface can be greatly customised. All options are explained in the file
<w>options_guide.txt</w> which can be found in the <w>docs</w> directory. The
options themselves are set in <w>init.txt</w> or <w>.crawlrc</w>. Crawl will
complain if it can't find either file.
%%%%
finished random 3

You can ask other Crawl players for advice and help on the <w>##crawl</w> IRC
(Internet Relay Chat) channel on freenode (<w>irc.freenode.net</w>).
%%%%
dissection reminder

If you don't want to eat it, consider offering this corpse up under prayer
(<input>$cmd[CMD_PRAY]</input>) as a sacrifice to {{ return you.god() }}.
<localtiles>You can also chop up any corpse that shows in the floor part of
your inventory tiles by clicking on it with your <input>left mouse
button</input>. </localtiles>Whenever you view a corpse while in hint mode you
can reread this information.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Xom

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Xom</w>. You can keep Xom happy by
keeping him amused; you do absolutely not want this god to grow bored with you!

If you keep Xom amused he'll treat you like a plaything, randomly helping and
harming you for his own amusement; otherwise he'll treat you like a disfavoured
plaything.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT

#
# Not the case for Chei, but not sure if we need to go into that much
# detail here.
#
# TODO: use $cmd for ^
You've just converted to worshipping <w>{{ return you.god() }}</w>. Your piety
(divine favour) will gradually decrease over time, and if it runs out {{ return
you.god() }} will excommunicate you and punish you. You can prevent this,
however, and even gain enough piety to get powers and divine gifts, by doing
things to please {{ return you.god() }}. But don't panic: you start out with a
decent amount of piety, so any danger of excommunication is far off.

You can check your god's likes and dislikes, as well as your current standing
and divine abilities, by typing <input>^</input><localtiles> (alternatively
press <input>Shift-right-click</input> on your avatar)</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_FIRST_OBJECT

That <console>$1 </console>is an item. If you move there and press
<input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input>, you will pick it up.<console> Generally, items
are shown by non-letter symbols like <w>%?!"=()[</w>.</console><tiles> You can
also pick up an item by clicking on your <input>left mouse button</input> while
standing on its square.</tiles> Also, several types of objects will usually be
picked up automatically. <tiles>These will be marked with a green frame around
them.</tiles>

Once it is in your inventory, you can drop it again with <tiles>a
<input>Shift-leftclick</input>. Whenever you <input>right-click</input> on an
item</tiles><console><input>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</input>. Any time you look at an
item in your inventory (<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</input>)</console>,
you can read about its properties and its description.
