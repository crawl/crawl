welcome

<white>Welcome to Dungeon Crawl!</white>

Your objective is to lead your <w>{{ return you.race() }} {{ return you.class()
}}</w> safely through the depths of the dungeon, retrieving the fabled Orb of
Zot and returning it to the surface. In the beginning, however, let discovery
be your main goal. Try to delve as deeply as possible but beware; death lurks
around every corner.

For the moment, just remember the following keys and their functions:
  <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input> — shows the items and the commands
  <input>$cmd[CMD_SAVE_GAME]</input>  — saves the game, to be resumed later
(but note that death is permanent)
  <input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</input>  — examines something in your vicinity

The hint mode will help you play Crawl without reading any documentation. If
you haven't yet, you might want to try out the tutorial. Also, if you feel
intrigued, there is more information available in the following files from the
docs/ directory (all of which can also be read in-game):
  <lightblue>quickstart.txt</lightblue>     — A very short guide to Crawl.
  <lightblue>crawl_manual.txt</lightblue>   — This contains all details on
species, magic, skills, etc.
  <lightblue>options_guide.txt</lightblue>  — Crawl's interface is highly
configurable. This document explains all the options.

Happy Crawling!
%%%%
death

Condolences! Your character's premature death is a sad, but common occurrence
in Crawl. Rest assured that with diligence and playing experience your
characters will last longer.

Perhaps the following advice can improve your playing style:
%%%%
death conjurer melee

As a Conjurer your main weapon should be offensive magic. Cast spells more
often! Remember to rest when your Magic is low.
%%%%
death berserker unberserked

Don't forget to go berserk when fighting particularly difficult foes. It's
risky, but makes you faster and beefier.
%%%%
death ranger melee

Your bow and arrows are extremely powerful against distant monsters.
%%%%
death random 0

Always consider using projectiles, wands or spells before engaging monsters in
close combat.
%%%%
death random 1

Learn when to run away from things you can't handle — this is important! It is
often wise to skip a particularly dangerous level. But don't overdo this as
monsters will only get harder the deeper you delve.
%%%%
death random 2

Rest between encounters, if possible in an area already explored and cleared of
monsters. Pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles>, or
<input>clicking on the 'rest' button in the command bar'</input></localtiles>
will rest for 100 turns, or until fully healed.
%%%%
death random 3

Remember to use those scrolls, potions or wands you've found. Learn to
improvise: you will need to identify potions and scrolls by using them.
%%%%
death random 4

If a particular encounter feels overwhelming, don't forget to use emergency
items early on. A scroll of teleportation or a potion of haste can really save
your bacon.
%%%%
death random 5

Never fight more than one monster, if you can help it. Always back into a
corridor so that they are forced to fight you one on one.
%%%%
finished

Congrats! You survived until the end of hints mode — be sure to try the
other characters as well. Note that the command help screen
(<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input>) will look very different from now
on. Here's a last playing hint:
%%%%
finished explored

Walking around and exploring levels gets easier by using auto-explore
(<input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input>). Crawl will let you automatically move to
and pick up interesting items.<localtiles>

Autoexploration can also be started by <input>Ctrl-Leftclick</input> on the
minimap.</localtiles>
%%%%
finished travel

There is a convenient way to travel between distant dungeon levels: press
<input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]</input> and enter the desired destination.
If your travel gets interrupted, issuing <input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]
Enter</input> will continue it.
%%%%
finished stashes

You can search among all items existing in the dungeon with the
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> command. For example,
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> <w>“dagger”</w> will list all daggers,
and allow you to travel to them. You can even search for dungeon features, like
<w>“shop”</w> or <w>“altar”</w>.
%%%%
finished random 0

The game keeps an automated log for your characters. Use
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]:</input> to read it. Once your character
perishes, two morgue files are left in the <w>morgue/</w> directory. The one
ending in .txt contains a copy of your log. During play, you can create a dump
file with <input>$cmd[CMD_CHARACTER_DUMP]</input>.
%%%%
finished random 1

Crawl has a macro function built in: press <input>$cmd[CMD_MACRO_MENU]</input>
to define a macro by first specifying a trigger key (say, <input>F1</input>)
and a command sequence, for example <input>za.</input>. The latter will make
the <input>F1</input> key always zap the spell in slot a at the nearest
monster. For more information on macros, type
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]~</input>.
%%%%
finished random 2

The interface can be greatly customised. All options are explained in the file
<w>options_guide.txt</w> which can be found in the <w>docs</w> directory. The
options themselves are set in <w>init.txt</w> or <w>.crawlrc</w>. Crawl will
complain if it can't find either file.
%%%%
finished random 3

You can ask other Crawl players for advice and help using any of the community
resources described at http://crawl.develz.org/
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Ashenzari

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Ashenzari</w>. Unlike other gods,
Ashenzari only cares about curses. As you explore the dungeon, Ashenzari will
offer curses, locking an item onto you. The more cursed items you wear, the more
Ashenzari will enhance your skills and otherwise help you.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Gozag

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Gozag</w>. Unlike other gods, Gozag only
cares about gold; each divine power costs gold, and your foes turn to gold on
death.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Ru

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Ru</w>. Unlike other gods, Ru grants
piety (divine favour) in exchange for permanent sacrifices, like losing the
ability to train certain skills, or permanently losing a hand. The more piety
you have, the more abilities Ru will grant, and the more powerful those
abilities will become. Ru will offer more sacrifices as you explore the depths
of the dungeon.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Uskayaw

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Uskayaw</w>. Unlike other gods,
Uskayaw's favour cannot be gradually gained as you explore the dungeon or slay
monsters. Instead, piety with Uskayaw is gained rapidly in combat as you deal
damage. The longer you remain in combat and the more damage you deal, the
greater the powers you will be offered. Once combat ends, Uskayaw's favour will
be quickly lost, and must be regained in the next battle.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Xom

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Xom</w>. As a follower of Xom, you'll
be treated like a plaything, randomly helped or harmed for Xom's own amusement.

There is no way to guarantee Xom remains in a good mood - the best any follower
can hope for is to avoid letting Xom grow bored!
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Yredelemnul

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Yredelemnul</w>. Unlike other gods,
Yredelemnul only cares about souls. Your enemies may rise to serve you after
death, and you can expend them to invoke Yredelemnul's aid.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT

You've just converted to worshipping <w>{{ return you.god() }}</w>. Your piety
(divine favour) will increase as you do things to please your new god, and will
gradually decrease over time.

You can check your god's likes and dislikes, as well as your current standing
and divine abilities, by typing
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</input><localtiles>, or by pressing
<input>Shift-right-click</input> on your avatar</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_FIRST_OBJECT

That <console>$1 </console>is an item. If you move there and press
<input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input><localtiles>, or <input>left-click</input> on it
in your inventory</localtiles>, you will pick it up.<console> Generally, items
are shown by non-letter symbols like <w>%?!"=()[</w>.</console> Some
objects<tiles>, marked with a green frame,</tiles> will be picked up
automatically.

Once it is in your inventory, you can drop it again with <localtiles>a
<input>Shift-left-click</input>. Whenever you <input>right-click</input> on an
item</localtiles><console><input>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</input>. Any time you look at an
item in your inventory (<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</input>)</console>,
you can read about its properties and its description.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_POTION

You have picked up your first potion<console> ('<w>$item[potion]</w>')</console>.
<localtiles>Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press</localtiles>
<nomouse>Press</nomouse> <w>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</w> to quaff it.

Once you've identified a potion, either with a scroll of identification or by
drinking it, you'll automatically recognize all other potions of the same type;
this means it's sometimes useful to drink potions just to identify them.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SCROLL

You have picked up your first scroll<console> ('<w>$item[scroll]</w>')</console>.
<localtiles>Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press</localtiles>
<nomouse>Press</nomouse> <w>$cmd[CMD_READ]</w> to read it.

Once you've identified a scroll, either with a scroll of identification or by
reading it, you'll automatically recognize all other scrolls of the same type;
this means it's sometimes useful to read scrolls just to identify them.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_WAND

You have picked up your first wand<console> ('<w>$item[wand]</w>')</console>.
<localtiles>Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press</localtiles>

If you find more wands of the same type, they'll merge into this wand and add
charges to it.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SPBOOK

You have picked up a book<console> ('<w>$item[book]</w>')</console>. On pickup,
its spells are immediately added to your library. You'll be able to memorise
spells from it via <w>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</w>, and cast them with

HINT_SEEN_WEAPON

This is the first weapon<console> ('<w>$item[weapon]</w>')</console> you've
picked up. Use <w>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</w><localtiles> or
<w>left-click</w> on it</localtiles> to wield it, but be aware that this
weapon might train a different skill from your current one. You can view the
weapon's properties from your

    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MISSILES

This is the first stack of missiles<console> ('<w>$item[missile]</w>')</console>
you've picked up. Missiles like boomerangs and throwing nets can be thrown by
hand, and become more effective as you train the Throwing skill.

%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ARMOUR

This is the first piece of armour<console> ('<w>$item[armour]</w>')</console>
you've picked up. <localtiles>You can click on it to wear it, and click again
to remove it. <w>Right-clicking</w> on it will give more information.

%%%%
HINT_SEEN_JEWELLERY

You have picked up a piece of jewellery, either a ring
<console>('<w>$item[jewellery]</w>') </console>or an
amulet<console> ('<w>$item[amulet]</w>')</console>.
<nomouse>Press <w>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_JEWELLERY]</w> to put it on and

<localtiles>You can click on it to put it on, and click again to remove it. By
<w>right-clicking</w> on it, you can view its properties.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MISC

This is a curious object indeed. You can play around with it to find out what
it does by <localtiles>clicking on it to e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oke </localtiles>
<nomouse>e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oking </nomouse>it. As usual, selecting it from
your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory might give you more information.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_STAFF

You have picked up a magic staff<console> ('<w>$item[magical staff]</w>')</console>.
It must be <w>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</w>ielded to be of use. Magicians use
staves to increase their power in certain spell schools. It can also be used as
a weapon.<localtiles> You can wield a staff by <w>left-clicking</w>.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_GOLD

You have picked up your first pile of gold<console>
('<yellow>$item[gold]</yellow>')</console>. Press <w>$cmd[CMD_LIST_GOLD]</w> to
see how much you have. Gold is used in shops you'll find as you explore.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_STAIRS

These<console> '$1'</console> are downstairs. You can enter the next (deeper)
level by following them down (<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>). To return to this
level, press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> while standing on the upstairs. When
you take new stairs, you get a free action; after that, monsters get to move
first.

<localtiles>Alternatively, you can <w>left-click</w> on stairs you're standing
on to use them.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ESCAPE_HATCH

This<console> '$1'</console> is an escape hatch. You can use it to leave a
level with <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> and <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>
respectively<localtiles> (or by<w>left-clicking</w>)</localtiles>, like stairs;
unlike stairs, however, hatches are a one-way trip, so be careful when
descending!
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_BRANCH

This<console> '$1'</console> is the entrance to a different branch of the
dungeon. Each branch has different terrain and monsters, and some contain
entrances to other branches. You can learn more by examining this
entrance<localtiles> by hovering your mouse over its tile</localtiles><nomouse
by pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</w> and moving the cursor onto it."

Some branches will be much safer and more rewarding than your current branch.
Others can be very dangerous, better visited when your character is more
powerful.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_PORTAL

This<console> '$1'</console> is a portal to an optional level, offering extra
loot in exchange for extra danger. There's no penalty for skipping it, but the
portal will disappear if you wait, so you have to decide now if you want to risk
it.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_BAZAAR_PORTAL

This<console> '$1'</console> is a portal to an inter-dimensional bazaar filled
with shops. It will disappear if you don't enter it soon, so hurry.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_PORTAL_2

You can enter a portal just like a set of stairs, by standing on it and
<localtiles><w>clicking</w> or </localtiles>pressing
<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>. To return, find <tiles>a similar looking portal.
</tiles><console>another $1 - but NOT the ancient stone arch you'll start out
on!</console>
%%%%
HINT_STAIR_BRAND

<tiles>A small symbol on a stair tile signifies that there are items in that
position that you may want to check out.</tiles>
<console>If any items are covering stairs or an escape hatch, then that will
be indicated by highlighting the <w><<</w> or <w>></w> symbol, instead of hiding
the stair symbol with an item glyph.</console>
%%%%
HINT_HEAP_BRAND

<tiles>A small symbol on an item tile signifies that there is at least one other
item in the same heap that you may want to check out.</tiles>
<console>If two or more items are on a single square, then the square will be
highlighted, and the symbol for the item on the top of the heap will be shown.
</console>
%%%%
HINT_TRAP_BRAND

<console>If any items are covering a trap, then that will be indicated by
highlighting the <w>^</w> symbol, instead of hiding the trap symbol with an item
glyph.</console>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_TRAP

You just discovered a trap. You'll occasionally find these nasty
constructions.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ALTAR

That<console> $1</console> is an altar.
<localtiles>By <w>right-clicking</w> on it with your mouse</localtiles>
<nomouse>If you target the altar with <w>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</w>, then press
<w>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</w></nomouse> you can get a short description.

Press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> or <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w> while
standing on the square to join the faith or read some information about the god
in question. Before taking up the corresponding faith you'll be asked for
confirmation.

{{
    if you.god() == "No God" and crawl.hints_type() == "magic" then
        return "The simplest god for an inexperienced conjurer is probably "
               .. "Vehumet, though many other gods, like Sif Muna, can also "
               .. "work well."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SHOP

That<console> $1</console> is a shop. You can enter it by typing
<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> or <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>
<tiles>, or by <w>left-clicking</w> on it<tiles>
while standing on the square.

If there's anything you want which you can't afford yet, you can hold
<w>Shift</w> and press the corresponding letter to put it on your shopping list.
The game will then remind you when you gather enough gold to buy it.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_DOOR

That<console> $1</console> is a closed door. You can open it by walking into it.
Sometimes it is useful to close a door. Do so by <nomouse>pressing
<w>$cmd[CMD_CLOSE_DOOR]</w> while next to it. If there are several doors, you
will then be prompted for a direction.</nomouse><localtiles>clicking on the door
while next to it.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_RUNED_DOOR

That<console> $1</console> is a runed door, which is probably in front of
something unusually dangerous. Monsters will never open it. If you do, the runes
will be broken, and it will become a normal door.
%%%%
HINT_KILLED_MONSTER

Congratulations, your character just gained experience by killing this monster!
This will raise some of your skills, making you more deadly.
{{
    if you.god() == "Trog" then
        return "Also, most kills will grant you favour in the eyes of Trog."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_NEW_LEVEL

Well done! Reaching a new experience level is always a nice event. You get more
health and magic points, and occasionally increases to your attributes:
strength, intelligence, and dexterity.

{{
    if crawl.hints_type() == "magic" then
        return "Gaining an experience level also lets you learn more difficult"
               .. " spells. You can memorise a second spell with"
               .. " <w>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</w><tiles> or by"
               .. " <w>clicking</w> on it in the memorisation tab</tiles>."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SKILL_RAISE

One of your skills just reached a milestone. The skills you use are
automatically trained whenever you gain experience, by killing monsters. By
default, experience goes to skills you actively use. To view or manage your
skills, type <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SKILLS]</w><localtiles> or click on the skill
tab in the bottom-right</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_MAGICAL_SKILL

Being skilled in a magical "school" makes it easier to learn and cast spells of
that school. Many spells belong to a combination of several schools, in which
case the average skill in these schools will determine spellcasting success and
power.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_MELEE_SKILL

Being skilled with a particular type of weapon will make you deal slightly more
damage and attack significantly faster with all weapons of that type. It's a
good idea to focus on just one weapon type, usually one you start with, though
finding a particularly good weapon may justify a switch.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_RANGED_SKILL

Being skilled with ranged weapons will let you deal slightly more damage and
attack significantly faster with them. Remember that wearing heavy armour makes
you attack more slowly with ranged weapons.
%%%%
HINT_CHOOSE_STAT

Upon gaining levels 3, 9, 15, etc., you get to choose an attribute to raise:
strength, intelligence, or dexterity.

<w>Strength</w> makes heavy armour less cumbersome and slightly increases most
weapons' damage.

<w>Intelligence</w> makes your spells more reliable and powerful.

<w>Dexterity</w> increases your evasion and stealth, and slightly increases the
damage of blades and ranged weapons.
# Also shields.
%%%%
HINT_MALEVOLENCE

As you explore the dungeon and reveal new tiles, the malevolent forces of the
dungeon may randomly cause bad things to happen to you. When this happens,
pause, think carefully, and be ready to use consumables or abilities. Fight to
survive!"
%%%%
HINT_OPPORTUNITY_ATTACK

When you move away from an enemy, they have a small (1/3) chance of taking
advantage and launching a free attack. Repositioning and retreating is often
still good, but keep an eye out for those extra attacks.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_ENCHANTED

Enchantments of all types can befall you temporarily.
Brief descriptions of these appear at the lower end of the stats area.
Press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_CHARACTER_STATUS]</w> for more details. You can search
for full enchantment descriptions by pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]/T</w>.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_POISON

Poison will rapidly reduce your health. You can wait it out with
<w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w>, but if you're in combat or lethally poisoned, you'll
probably want to quaff a potion of curing.
%%%%
HINT_MULTI_PICKUP

There are a lot of items here. You choose what to pick up from a menu:
press <w>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</w><localtiles> or <w>click</w> on the player
doll</localtiles> to enter the pickup menu. To leave the menu, confirm your
selection with <w>Enter</w>.
%%%%
HINT_FULL_INVENTORY

Sadly, your inventory is limited to 52 items, and it appears your knapsack is
full. However, this is easy enough to rectify: simply <w>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</w>rop
some of the stuff you don't need right now. In the drop menu you can then
comfortably select which items to drop by pressing their inventory
letter<localtiles>, or by clicking on them</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_SHIFT_RUN

Walking around takes fewer keystrokes if you press <w>Shift-direction</w> or
<w>/ direction</w>. That will let you run until a monster comes into sight or
your character sees something interesting.
%%%%
HINT_MAP_VIEW

As you explore a level, orientation can become difficult. Press
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]</w> to bring up the level map. Typing <w>?</w> shows
the list of level map commands. Most importantly, moving the cursor to a spot
and pressing <w>.</w> or <w>Enter</w> lets your character move there on its own.

<localtiles>Also, clicking on the right-side minimap with your <w>right mouse
button</w> will zoom into that dungeon area. Clicking with the <w>left mouse
button</w> instead will let you move there.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_AUTO_EXPLORE

Fully exploring a level and picking up all the interesting looking items can be
tedious. To save on this tedium you can press <w>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</w> to
auto-explore, which will automatically explore unmapped regions, automatically
pick up interesting items, and stop if a monster or interesting dungeon feature
(stairs, altar, etc.) is encountered.
%%%%
HINT_DONE_EXPLORE

Hey, you've finished exploring the dungeon on this level! You can search for
stairs from the level map (<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]</w>) by pressing <w>></w>.
The cursor will jump to the nearest staircase, and by pressing <w>.</w> or
<w>Enter</w> your character can move there, too. Each level of Crawl has three
<console>white </console>up and three <console>white </console>down stairs.
Unexplored parts can often be accessed via another level.
%%%%
HINT_AUTO_EXCLUSION

To prevent autotravel or autoexplore taking you into dangerous territory, you
can set travel exclusions by entering the map view (<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]</w>)
and then toggling the exclusion radius on the monster position with <w>e</w>.
To make this easier, some immobile monsters listed in the <w>auto_exclude</w>
option (such as this one) are considered dangerous enough to warrant an
automatic setting of an exclusion. It will be automatically cleared if you
manage to kill the monster. You could also manually remove the exclusion with
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]ee</w> but unless you remove this monster from the
auto_exclude list, the exclusion will be reset the next turn.
%%%%
HINT_HEALING_POTIONS

Your health is getting dangerously low. Retreating and/or quaffing a potion of
heal wounds or curing might be a good idea.
%%%%
HINT_NEED_HEALING

If you're low on health or magic and there's no urgent need to move, you can
rest for a bit. Ideally, you should retreat to an area you've already explored
and cleared of monsters before resting, since resting on the edge of the
explored terrain increases the risk of rest being interrupted by a wandering
monster. Press <w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w> or <w>shift-numpad-5</w>
<localtiles>, or click on the 'rest' button,</localtiles> to do so.
%%%%
HINT_NEED_POISON_HEALING

You are lethally poisoned, so now would be a good time to
<w>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</w>uaff a potion of heal wounds or, better yet, a potion of
curing. If you have seen neither of these so far, try unknown potions in your
inventory. Good luck!
%%%%
HINT_ON_FIRE

You have been covered in sticky liquid flame. You can put this out more quickly
by spending your turns moving, or put it out entirely by walking into a nearby
pool of water. Whatever covered you in liquid flames may light you further on
fire while you run around, however.
%%%%
HINT_INVISIBLE_DANGER

Fighting against a monster you cannot see is difficult. If you don't have a
source of see invisibility, you can find invisible monsters by luring them into
shallow water, opaque clouds (from a scroll of fog), or a corridor, where their
movements will be more predictable. If things go south, try teleporting out, or
leaving the level entirely!
%%%%
HINT_NEED_HEALING_INVIS

You recently noticed an invisible monster, so unless you killed it or left the
scene, resting might not be safe. If you still need to replenish your health or
magic, you'll have to quaff an appropriate potion. For normal resting you will
first have to get away from the danger.
%%%%
HINT_CAN_BERSERK

Against particularly difficult foes, you should use your Berserk
<w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w>bility. Killing monsters while berserking makes it
last longer.
%%%%
HINT_POSTBERSERK

Berserking is extremely exhausting! Afterwards you are slowed down, and you
won't be able to berserk again until enough time passes for your exhaustion to
fade.
%%%%
HINT_RUN_AWAY_1

Whenever your health is very low and you're in danger of dying, check your
options carefully. Often, retreat or use of some item might be a viable
alternative to fighting on.
%%%%
HINT_LAST_MINUTE_BERSERK

With Trog's support, you can use your Berserk ability
(<w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w>) to temporarily gain more health and greater
strength. Bear in mind that berserking at the last minute is often risky,
and prevents you from using items to escape!
%%%%
HINT_RUN_AWAY_2

If retreating to another level, keep in mind that monsters may follow you if
they're standing right next to you when you start climbing or descending the
stairs. And even if you've managed to shake them off, they'll still be there
when you come back, so you might want to use a different set of stairs when you
return.
%%%%
HINT_RETREAT_CASTER

Without magical power you're unable to cast spells. While melee is a
possibility, that's not where your strengths lie, so retreat (if possible) might
be the better option.
%%%%
HINT_ADVISE_USE_WAND

\nOr you could e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oke a wand to harm or weaken your foes.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_MUTATED

Mutations can be good or bad. Potions of mutation are the most common way to
remove bad mutations, though they can also give you new ones. Check your
mutations with <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MUTATIONS]</w>.
%%%%
HINT_NEW_ABILITY_GOD_PASSIVE

You just gained a divine ability. Press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</w>
<localtiles> or press <w>Shift</w> and <w>right-click</w> on the player
tile</localtiles> to take a look at your abilities.
%%%%
HINT_NEW_ABILITY_GOD_ACTIVE

You just gained a divine ability. Press <w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w> to take a
look at your abilities or to use one of them.
%%%%
HINT_NEW_ABILITY_ITEM

That item you just equipped granted you a new ability. Press
<w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w><localtiles> (or <w>click</w> in the <w>command
panel</w>)</localtiles> to take a look at your abilities or to use one of them.
%%%%
HINT_ITEM_FLIGHT

Flight will allow you to cross deep water or lava. Items that allow you to fly
will activate automatically when worn.
%%%%
HINT_ITEM_RESISTANCES

Equipping this item affects your resistances. Check the overview screen
(<w>$cmd[CMD_RESISTS_SCREEN]</w><localtiles> or click on the <w>character
overview button</w> in the command panel</localtiles>) for details.
%%%%
HINT_GOD_DISPLEASED

Uh-oh, $1 is growing displeased because your piety is running low. Possibly this
is the case because you're committing heretical acts, because $1 finds your
worship lacking, or a combination of the two. If your piety goes to zero, then
you'll be excommunicated. Better get cracking on raising your piety, and/or stop
annoying your god. In any case, you'd better reread the religious description.
To do so, press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</w><localtiles> or press
<w>Shift</w> and <w>right-click</w> on your avatar</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_WIELD_WEAPON

You can easily switch back to your weapon in slot a by
pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_WEAPON_SWAP]</w>. To change the slot of an item, press
<w>$cmd[CMD_ADJUST_INVENTORY]i</w> and choose the appropriate slots.
%%%%
HINT_FLEEING_MONSTER

Now that monster is scared of you! Note that you do not absolutely have to
follow it. Rather, you can let it run away. Sometimes, though, it can be useful
to attack a fleeing creature by throwing something after it. If you have any
stones in your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory, you can look at one
of them to read an explanation of how to do this.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_BRAND

That monster looks a bit unusual. You might wish to examine it a bit more
closely by <localtiles>hovering your mouse over its tile.</localtiles>
<nomouse>pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</w> and moving the cursor onto its
square.</nomouse>
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_FRIENDLY

That monster is friendly to you and will attack your enemies. You can command
your allies by pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_SHOUT]</w>.
%%%%
HINT_TEMPORARILY_FRIENDLY

However, it is only <w>temporarily</w> friendly, and will become dangerous
again when this friendliness wears off.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_SHOUTED_UNSEEN

Uh-oh, some monster noticed you, either one that's around a corner or one that's
invisible. Plus, the noise it made will alert other monsters in the vicinity,
who will come to check out what the commotion was about.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_SHOUTED_SEEN

Uh-oh, that monster noticed you! Plus, the noise it made will alert other
monsters in the vicinity, who will come to check out what the commotion
was about.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_NO_SHOUT

Uh-oh, that monster noticed you! Fortunately, it didn't make any noise, but many
monsters do make noise when they notice you. That will alert other monsters in
the area, who will come to check out what the commotion was about.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_LEFT_LOS

$1 didn't vanish, but merely moved onto a square which you can't currently see.
It's still nearby, unless something happens to it in the short amount of time
it's out of sight.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ZERO_EXP_MON

That<console> $1</console> is $2. While <w>technically</w> a monster, it's
more like dungeon furniture, since it's harmless and doesn't move. If it's in
your way you can attack and kill it like other monsters, but you won't get any
experience for doing so.
%%%%
HINT_ABYSS

Uh-oh, you've wound up in the Abyss! The Abyss is a special place where you
cannot remember or map where you've been; it is filled with nasty monsters, and
you're probably going to die.

To increase your chances of survival until you can find the exit<console> (a
flickering <w>$1</w>)</console>, keep moving, don't fight any of the monsters,
and don't chase after items on the ground. If monsters are closing in, try to
use items and abilities to get away.
%%%%
HINT_SPELL_MISCAST_EFFECTS

Miscasting a spell can have nasty consequences, particularly for the more
difficult spells. Your chance of successfully casting a spell increases with
your magic skills, and can also be improved with the help of some items. Use
the <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</w> command<localtiles> or mouse over the spell
tiles</localtiles> to check your current failure rates.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_MISCAST

You just miscast a spell.
%%%%
HINT_MISCAST_ARMOUR

Wearing heavy body armour or using a shield, especially a large one, can
severely hamper your spellcasting abilities. You can check the effect of this
by comparing the failure rates on the <w>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]\?</w> screen with
and without the item being worn.
%%%%
HINT_MISCAST_CONTAMINATION_AND_MP

If the spellcasting success chance is high (which can be checked by entering
<w>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]\?</w> or <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</w>) then a miscast
merely means the spell is not working, along with a harmless side effect.
However, for spells with a high failure rate, there's a chance of contaminating
yourself with magical energy, plus a chance of an additional harmful side
effect. Normally this isn't a problem, since magical contamination bleeds off
over time, but if you're repeatedly contaminated in a short amount of time
you'll mutate or suffer from other ill side effects.

Note that a miscast spell will still consume the full amount of MP that a
successfully cast spell would.
%%%%
HINT_GLOWING

You've accumulated so much magical contamination that you're glowing! You
usually acquire magical contamination from using some powerful magics, like
invisibility, or from miscasting spells.

%%%%
HINT_CONTAMINATION_MILD

As long as the status only shows in grey nothing will actually happen as a
result of it, but as you continue suffusing yourself with magical contamination
you'll eventually start glowing for real, which can have nasty effects, such as
mutating you or dealing direct damage. In addition, glowing is going to make you
much more noticeable.
%%%%
HINT_CONTAMINATION_SEVERE

This normally isn't a problem as contamination slowly bleeds off on its own, but
it seems that you've accumulated so much contamination over a short amount of
time that it can have nasty effects, such as mutating you or dealing direct
damage. In addition, glowing is going to make you much more noticeable.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_RESIST

Most attacks in Crawl are defended against by your AC. Some, like fire or
draining attacks, can be further reduced by specific resistances. Other magical
effects, such as Slow or Confusion hexes, are resisted by your willpower.
You'll find items that increase both kinds of resistances.

To view your current set of resistances, <localtiles><w>right-click</w> on the
player avatar, or </localtiles>press <w>$cmd[CMD_RESISTS_SCREEN]</w>.
%%%%
HINT_CAUGHT_IN_NET

While you are held in a net, you cannot move around or engage monsters in
combat. Instead, any movement you take is counted as an attempt to struggle free
from the net.
{{
    if crawl.hints_type() == "magic" then
        return "Note that casting spells is still very much possible, as is"
               .. " using wands, scrolls and potions."
    else
        return "Note that using wands, scrolls and potions is still very much"
               .. " possible."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_YOU_SILENCE

While you are silenced, you cannot cast spells, read scrolls or use divine
invocations. The same is true for any monster within the effect radius. The
field of silence (recognizable by <tiles>the special-looking frame tiles</tiles>
<console>different-coloured floor squares</console>) is always centered on you
and will move along with you. The radius will gradually shrink, eventually
making you the only one affected, before the effect fades entirely.
%%%%
HINT_AUTOPICKUP_THROWN

When stepping on items you've thrown, they will be picked up automatically.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_SPELLCASTING

As your Spellcasting skill increases, you will be able to memorise more spells,
and will have somewhat more MP. You'll also beomce lsightly better at casting
all kinds of spells.

Press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SKILLS]</w> <localtiles>(or click on the <w>skill
button </w>in the command panel)</localtiles>to have a look at your skills and
manage their training.
%%%%
HINT_FUMBLING_SHALLOW_WATER

Fighting in shallow water will sometimes cause you to slip and fumble your
attack. If possible, try to fight on firm ground.
%%%%
HINT_CLOUD_WARNING

Rather than step into this cloud and hurt yourself, you should either wait for a
few turns to see if it vanishes (with <w>$cmd[CMD_WAIT]</w>), or just step
around it.
%%%%
HINT_FOUND_UNKNOWN

You've found something new (but I don't know what)!
%%%%
