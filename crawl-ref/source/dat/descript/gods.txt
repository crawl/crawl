Zin

Zin's followers can safely convert to Elyvilon and the Shining One.

To worship Xom is to live riskily. In a good mood Xom may shower you with gifts, while at other times this capricious god could decide to "spice things up a little" and send you to your doom. If you prove yourself the stronger, so much the better; if not, well, there'll be other playthings...

All slimes will never harm a follower of Jiyva, and Jiyva demands that worshippers do the same. Eventually, all visible slimes will join in on a prayer, preventing them from moving for a while.
