Zin

Zin is a God for those focused on inner strength. Followers must remain pure of
body and soul, refraining from unholy, evil, unclean or chaotic magic; the use
of mutations and the consumption of intelligent beings' flesh. They may preach
to or imprison the unenlightened, and can ultimately gain a divine refuge. Zin
values selflessness, demanding a tithe (one tenth) of all gold gained,
preferably followed by donations of more. Zin's followers can convert to
Elyvilon or the Shining One while keeping some of their piety.
%%%%
the Shining One

The Shining One is a powerful deity on a crusade against all evil. Followers
and their allies may be granted various blessings upon mercilessly slaying evil
and unholy beings. Worshippers must never use unholy or evil magic, and are
expected to prove their moral superiority by fighting honourably. The God
demands followers to scour the world, examining all of its inhabitants for
traces of evil that must be eradicated. The Shining One's followers can convert
to Elyvilon or Zin while keeping some of their piety.
%%%%
Kikubaaqudgha

Kikubaaqudgha is a terrible Demon-God, served by those who wish to indulge in
the powers of death. Kikubaaqudgha is evil, and requires the deaths of living
creatures and demons as often as possible.
%%%%
Yredelemnul

Yredelemnul the Dark is an evil God worshipped by those who seek powers over
death and the undead. Followers, who must oppose all things holy, can raise
legions of servile undead, and gain a number of other useful (if unpleasant)
powers. Yredelemnul appreciates killing, but prefers corpses to be put to use
rather than sacrificed. Destroying artificial beings is also favoured, as they
are neither truly alive nor subject to death or undeath.
%%%%
Xom

Xom is a wild and unpredictable God of chaos, who seeks not worshippers but
playthings with which to toy. Many choose to follow Xom in the hope of
receiving fabulous rewards and mighty powers, but Xom is nothing if not
capricious. Also, there is nothing a follower can do to influence Xom's mood.
%%%%
Vehumet

Vehumet is a God of the destructive powers of magic. Followers gain various
useful powers to enhance their command of the hermetic arts, and the most
favoured stand to gain access to some of the fearsome spells in Vehumet's
library. One's devotion to Vehumet can be proven by the causing of as much
carnage and destruction as possible.
%%%%
Okawaru

Okawaru is a dangerous and powerful God of battle. Followers can gain a number
of powers useful in combat as well as various rewards, but must constantly
prove themselves through battle and the sacrifice of corpses. Okawaru prefers
heroic feats against much stronger enemies, and pays little heed to easier
victories. Furthermore, while fair fights are not required, harming one's
allies will incur Okawaru's wrath.
%%%%
Makhleb

Makhleb the Destroyer is a fearsome deity of bloodshed and mortification of the
flesh. Followers are expected to cleanse others by inflicting suffering and
death on them in Makhleb's name, and can gain further favour by ravaging the
freshly dead. Dedicated followers may also access the raw energies and
hell-spawned servants of chaos, so that they may better break the impure world
and its false laws for this evil God's glory.
%%%%
Sif Muna

Sif Muna the Loreminder is a contemplative but powerful deity, served by those
who seek magical knowledge. The Loreminder appreciates the training of spell
casting skills.
%%%%
Trog

Trog is an ancient God of anger and violence. Followers are expected to kill in
Trog's name and sacrifice the dead, and in return gain power in battle and also
occasional rewards. Trog hates all wizards, and loves to see their spellbooks
burn. Followers are forbidden the use of spell magic.
%%%%
Nemelex Xobeh

Nemelex is a strange and unpredictable trickster God, whose powers can be
invoked through the magical packs of cards painted in the ichor of demons.
Followers are expected to sedulously sacrifice valuable items, the type of
which will influence the gifts. Followers are also advised to trust in the
cards and use them as much as possible. However, the Trickster can ensure that
fortune favours the bold.
%%%%
Elyvilon

Elyvilon the Healer welcomes all good souls who are prepared to help others.
Those individuals can expect to gain powerful healing abilities. The Healer
prefers a creed of pacifism, and helps worshippers avoid bloodshed. Elyvilon
appreciates the destruction of weapons, though more pious worshippers must find
and destroy unholy or evil weapons to gain piety in this way. Elyvilon's
followers can convert to the Shining One or Zin while keeping some of their
piety.
%%%%
Lugonu

Lugonu the Unformed revels in the chaos of the Abyss. Followers are sent out to
cause bloodshed and corruption in the overworld, and must do so unflaggingly to
earn this evil God's favour.
%%%%
Beogh

Beogh is the deity worshipped by the cave orcs native to parts of the dungeon.
Only orcs may devote their service to Beogh, and must prove their devotion by
bloodshed and the blessing of dead orcs. Devout followers of Beogh can smite
their foes, and especially fervent devotees of Beogh may even gain followers of
their own, for the orcs still look for their Messiah.
%%%%
Fedhas

Fedhas Madash is the god of plant and fungal life. Fedhas demands that
followers encourage the decomposition of corpses. Fedhas forbids followers from
harming any species under Fedhas' protection, and from using any necromantic
effects that interfere with corpses. In return Fedhas grants a number of
abilities that promote the growth of plants and fungi. These abilities may
incidentally prove useful to adventurers.
%%%%
Cheibriados

Cheibriados is a god who meditates on the mystery of time. Those who choose to
follow this deity's path will learn to eschew unnecessary haste, slow down both
themselves and others, and hurt those who refuse to slow down. Especially
devout followers may even temporarily abandon the flow of time and its needless
disturbances.
%%%%
Ashenzari

While it seems inconceivable that the divine could be shackled, Ashenzari is
just that: being purposely nailed to the sky for eternity, the unbudging god is
all-knowing, all-seeing. Devoted worshippers are allowed to grasp shreds of
this knowledge and foresight, but be warned: to Ashenzari, power and blessing
and curse are all the same thing.
%%%%
Jiyva

Jiyva is the chaotic ancient deity of the slimes. Followers are expected to
support the spread and satiation of their fellow slimes by allowing them to
consume items, and are forbidden from harming any slimes. Jiyva will even
occasionally consume items left elsewhere in the Dungeon by followers.
Especially favoured followers will become as shapeless as their god, as their
attributes and mutations shift around under Jiyva's influence.
%%%%
Zin powers

Zin grants followers the ability to preach to the unenlightened masses, and
powers to vitalise their bodies and gain divine stamina, protecting them from
various afflictions as well as giving sustenance to the hungry. Later,
followers gain the ability to imprison their foes temporarily. Followers can
eventually find temporary safety in a divine refuge. As piety grows, followers
will be protected from mutation, and Zin may even occasionally directly
intervene to save a follower's life.
%%%%
the Shining One powers

Followers of the Shining One are surrounded by a halo that reveals their
enemies to them. They gain power by killing evil beings. The Shining One will
keep summoned and charmed allies on their side longer, should the allies prove
worthy of the crusade. Followers will gain use of a divine shield to protect
them in battle. Later, they can channel blasts of cleansing flame that are
particularly damaging to unholy beings. Eventually, they can ask the Shining
One to send them powerful divine beings as allies. The Shining One may
occasionally directly intervene to save a follower's life. With growing piety
the Shining One will protect a follower's life force.
%%%%
Kikubaaqudgha powers

Kikubaaqudgha will send corpses to followers, enhance servants' necromantic
prowess with gifts of spellbooks, and imbue their weapons with pain. Especially
fervent followers can protect themselves from torment, or even invoke it
themselves by offering a cadaver to Kikubaaqudgha.
%%%%
Yredelemnul powers

Yredelemnul gives you the power to raise skeletons and corpses to fight on your
side, to recall your undead followers to your vicinity, and to heal hit points
by draining the life force of living creatures. Eventually, you'll gain the
power to bind a monster's soul, and make it fight for you instead. Yredelemnul
will sporadically gift you with stronger undead servants. Also, with sufficient
piety, Yredelemnul will mirror any injury you have to suffer onto the attacker.
%%%%
Xom powers

To worship Xom is to live riskily. In a good mood Xom may shower you with
gifts, while at other times this capricious god could decide to “spice things
up a little” and send you to your doom. If you prove yourself the stronger, so
much the better; if not, well, there'll be other playthings...
%%%%
Vehumet powers

Worshippers of Vehumet will quickly be able to recover their magical energy
upon killing beings. As they gain favour, they will also gain enhancements to
their destructive spells — first assistance in casting such spells and then
increased range for conjurations. Vehumet will offer followers the knowledge of
increasingly powerful destructive spells as they gain piety.
%%%%
Okawaru powers

Followers will soon gain the ability to temporarily increase their skills in
combat, and, much later, to deal much faster blows. Okawaru will eventually
gift followers with weapons and armour.
%%%%
Makhleb powers

Makhleb offers followers various means to inflict immense damage, and to call
in help from powerful demons, although these powers come with a price in blood.
However, Makhleb will grant followers renewed health in return for killing
beings of all kinds.
%%%%
Sif Muna powers

Followers of Sif Muna can channel magical energy when they need it the most,
and they gain a power to forget any spell at will, so as to learn new ones. Sif
Muna protects spellcasters against the negative effects of miscasting a spell.
Over time, followers will get spellbooks containing all spells to be found in
the realm.
%%%%
Trog powers

Trog offers various powers to help you in battle, namely the ability to go
berserk at will, and the ability to make wounds heal more quickly while
increasing resistance to magical effects. Later, followers may call in powerful
raging allies. Eventually, Trog will gift followers with weapons focused on
damage.
%%%%
Nemelex Xobeh powers

The Trickster's followers gain various ways to influence fate when playing
cards.
%%%%
Elyvilon powers

The Healer offers followers means to heal themselves from damage and other ill
effects. Elyvilon also allows healing of hostile monsters, trying to turn them
neutral. Elyvilon may directly intervene to save a follower's life, especially
when called upon; highly pious followers can be sure of such aid.
%%%%
Lugonu powers

Followers of Lugonu gain powers to depart the Abyss at will, to bend space
around themselves, and to banish monsters to the Abyss. Later they will be able
to corrupt the ordered world, opening a gate for creatures of the Abyss to pass
through, and to gate themselves directly into this realm of chaos. Lugonu will
eventually offer to corrupt a follower's weapon, imbuing it with the distorting
energies of the Abyss. Lugonu expects followers to spread unceasing chaos in
the overworld, and as such does not grant piety to worshippers while they
remain in the Abyss itself.
%%%%
Beogh powers

Beogh encourages followers to make use of orcish gear found in the dungeon.
Followers can smite their foes, and will even gain orcish followers of their
own, who may be blessed by Beogh in battle and can be recalled to your vicinity
as needed. Eventually, they'll gain the power to walk on water. Beogh will
sometimes directly intervene to save a follower's life. {{
    if you.race() == "Lava Orc" then
        return "Beogh suppresses the heat aura of Lava Orc followers."
    end
}}
%%%%
Fedhas powers

Plants and fungi will not attack Fedhas' worshippers without provocation.
Fedhas' worshippers may walk through plants or fungi, and even fire missiles or
spells through them without causing harm. Fedhas grants the ability to promote
plants and fungi into stronger species. Followers can eventually grow a wall of
plants and create explosive spores from corpses. They are also granted some
control over the weather, being able to call sunlight and eventually
rainstorms.
%%%%
Cheibriados powers

Followers of Cheibriados move more slowly as they gain favour, and are rewarded
for killing creatures who are faster than they are. Moving too quickly or using
magically hastened weapons is frowned upon. Cheibriados rewards the faithful
with a slowed metabolism, the power to slow other creatures, the power to
distort the flow of time, the power to harm those who move more quickly than
they do, and, finally, the ability to step out of the flow of time entirely.
%%%%
Jiyva powers

Jiyva's followers can request jellies, turn monsters to slime, and eventually
remove their harmful mutations. As their piety grows, Jiyva will, with
increasing frequency, drop jellies into the dungeon; rearrange followers'
attributes based on their skills, armour, and burden; and grant mutation gifts.
Slimes will never harm a follower of Jiyva, and Jiyva demands the same conduct
in return. Eventually, all visible slimes will join in on prayers, preventing
them from moving for awhile.
%%%%
Ashenzari powers

Ashenzari exhorts followers to garb themselves with curses, and provides
rewards for time spent using cursed armour, jewelry or weapons. Ashenzari's
ultimate desire, however, is not for devotion but the knowledge of all things.
Pious worshippers willing to part with a portion of their knowledge will
receive a great portion of Ashenzari's in return.
