higher power, the spirit becomes more durable.

zombies raised by this spell increases with spell power.

Reanimates a single skeleton as a follower, even if that skeleton is still
encased in flesh. This magic is unstable, so eventually those reanimated will
crumble to dust. Skeletons cannot leave the level they were created on. The
resilience of a skeleton raised by this spell increases with spell power.
%%%%
Apportation spell

Pulls the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor

%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently
lessens their resilience to injury, to a degree dependent on (and inversely
related to) power.

It is powerful enough to cancel the effects of Death's Door, although doing so
will briefly paralyse the caster. It has no effect on the undead.
%%%%

Calls forth hands from corpses interred beneath the dungeon floor long ago.
Enemies caught in the area will be held in place and constricted until they
break free.

<Brothers in Arms ability>
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar spell

%%%%
Call Down Damnation spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation, with no direct line of fire required.

creatures, usually those able to invoke damnation themselves, are entirely
unscathed by damnation.

or nearly adjacent cannot be struck by this.
%%%%

wildly and are usually, but not always, positive.
%%%%

morale. They have no noticeable effect.

effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.

become intense enough to slow and asphyxiate.
%%%%

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch spell

Enchants the caster's dominant hand with magical energy. This energy is
released when the caster touches a monster, and may induce a state of confusion
in the monster. The caster's attacks do no damage while attempting to touch a
monster in this way.
%%%%
Confusion Gaze spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind, with no
direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. Casters are advised to use caution;
the lightning is not mindful of what it may hit.

The magic which keeps ball lightnings cohesive has limited range, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if allowed to drift too far away from their caster before
exploding.
%%%%
Conjure Flame spell

Creates a cloud of magically sustained fire at the caster's feet. The fire takes
a moment to begin burning with vigor and in its fragile initial state is easily
smothered by either the caster or a wandering monster. Re-casting the spell
will bring the fire fully to life, but will burn the caster.
%%%%
Corona spell

Causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature.
This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and makes the
affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corpse Rot spell

Rapidly accelerates the decomposition of any corpses lying around the caster,
and gathers the foul miasmic vapour around the caster. The clouds eat away at
the life force of any creature they envelop.
%%%%
Corrosive Bolt spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of acid.
%%%%
Corrupting Pulse spell

Instills a corruption within all visible targets, temporarily mutating their
bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the

next to those walls will be frozen and will find their movements slowed.

randomly imbued with either fire or ice, and additionally will reflect from
walls of any material due to the crystal embedded in the shot.
%%%%
Dazzling Flash spell

The caster erupts in a scintillating display of light. Any living creature
nearby may be dazzled and left stumbling blindly.
%%%%

a state of spectral slavery. When the channel expires the spectres are released
from bondage.
%%%%
Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left more resilient when the effect ends. It has no effect on those who
are already undead.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

Fires a ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Dig spell

Digs a tunnel through unworked rock.
%%%%

Drives nearby creatures into an insane frenzy, causing them to mercilessly
attack anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

Destabilizes the space in a sphere around the caster for a while, causing
anyone nearby to blink away from the caster. The chance of blinking depends on
the distance from the caster, being nearly certain when directly adjacent. It
causes magical contamination when cast.

Harms an adjacent undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces
binding it together.
%%%%
Dispel Undead Range spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

Teleports away any creatures within a short distance of the caster. Any
creature that resists the effect will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a chance of being confused by
the warping of space.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.
%%%%

}} The caster becomes able to deal incredible damage in melee combat, and
they become much more robust, although their evasiveness is reduced.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.
%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon
to engage the summoner's enemies. The spell is taxing to maintain, and each new
dragon which answers the call will further drain the summoner's magical
reserves. After the call ends, it cannot be issued again for a short time.
%%%%
Drain Life spell

Drains the life force of any nearby creatures, healing the user depending on

%%%%
Entropic Weave spell

Corrodes the target, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Eringya's Noxious Bog spell

Causes the caster to release a torrent of sludge that transforms nearby areas
into a toxic bog. The sludge damages and poisons all monsters, even those
resistant to poison. The bog cannot form on areas adjacent to solid features,
nor on areas that lack solid floor, like deep water or lava. The transformation
is temporary and cannot be sustained out of the caster's sight. Spellpower will
increase how long the bog lingers.
%%%%
Eruption spell

Splits the earth to draw up a localized, short-lived volcano under the target.
%%%%
Excruciating Wounds spell

Temporarily infuses the weapon held by the caster with the essence of pain
itself. It will not affect artefact weapons.

While a weapon is infused it cannot be unwielded and casting spells is slightly
more difficult.
%%%%
Flay spell

Opens painful illusionary wounds on the target's body, which disappear after
a short time or on the death of the caster. This cannot kill directly, and is
ineffective against unnatural targets.
%%%%

target back.
%%%%
Forceful Invitation spell

the Vaults, or the Crypt; the specific branch varies with the caster.
%%%%

rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. They will dissipate harmlessly
if unable to reach a target or if the caster swaps places with them.

target may have. This may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.
%%%%
Freezing Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%
Frozen Ramparts spell

Encases surrounding walls with ice for a short time as long as the caster
refrains from moving. Victims that wander near the icy walls will be damaged,
and this may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures. The damage dealt bypasses
any armour the target may have. Each victim is only ever affected by one icy
wall at a time.

The caster and any allies can safely remain near icy walls. The ice will crack
and fall away if the caster moves to a new position.
%%%%
Fulminant Prism spell

Conjures a prism which unleashes a violent explosion of arcane force after a
short duration. The prism is extremely fragile and any damage caused to it may
result in premature detonation.

that point. All nearby creatures, save the caster, fall helplessly toward that
point – typically colliding with each other, or with a victim standing there.

Hurls an exploding ball of negative energy which drains any living creature
it engulfs.
%%%%

%%%%
Throw Ally spell

Throws a nearby ally at the monster's foe, doing minimal damage and landing the
thrown monster nearby.
%%%%
Glaciate spell

Conjures forth a mighty blast of ice. Creatures within its cone-shaped area of
effect take damage, with higher damage being dealt to those close to the
caster. Those hit by the blast are encased in ice, slowing their movement, and
those killed by the blast may be frozen into solid blocks of ice. A significant
portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.

Calls giant grasping roots from deep underground that hold and constrict their
victim. The roots will retreat if the victim breaks free or if the caller moves
out of view.

Goad Beasts spell

Provokes nearby beasts to act faster. The effect is fleeting, but repeated use
can move even the most stubborn mule.

adjacent to the caster are unaffected. Due to the strong impact and cutting
edges a significant portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.

%%%%
Harpoon Shot spell

Fires a long and flexible barbed mass. The ensnared victim will either be
pulled adjacent to the caster or collide with anything blocking the way.

gods. These flames are especially dangerous to undead and demonic creatures,

Traps an enemy in a ring of blessed flame. These flames are especially
dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy
creatures.
%%%%
Hydra Form spell

Transforms the caster into an amphibious, many-headed hydra for a brief
duration. Its multiple heads strike in all directions. Foes slain by the
gnashing teeth are instantly devoured, reinvigorating the caster in their
reptilian rampage. The caster gains innate armour and increased health, and
becomes resistant to poison.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded. The form's
number of heads is fixed upon casting the spell, and increases with power.
%%%%
Iceblast spell

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. It affects even
cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Ice Form spell

water. The caster gains a freezing melee attack, and becomes incredibly
resistant to cold and resistant to poison, but vulnerable to fire.

Converts all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning poisoned creatures from
within. It also turns clouds of poison and mephitic gases into flame. The

All foes in the caster's surroundings are engulfed in balls of fire. The caster
and their allies are protected from the fire and will never be harmed by this

depending on power and causing death scarabs to grow and burst from them upon
death.

to the caster.
%%%%

Reflects damage taken for a short duration, hurting attackers whenever any
damage is taken.
%%%%
Ink Cloud spell

Fills an enemy with an intense fire. This fire is released any time the target
is hit, and explosively released upon death. The size of the explosion caused
is dependent on the size of the target.
%%%%
Invisibility spell

Turns a targeted creature invisible. Turning invisible causes magical
contamination and may eventually cause glowing, nullifying the invisibility.
%%%%
Invisibility Other spell

Turns a nearby ally invisible.
%%%%
Iron Shot spell

Hurls a large and heavy metal shot.
%%%%
Irradiate spell

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures. It heavily deforms
its targets, weakening them and reducing their armour. The caster is not left
entirely unaffected; some of the magic lingers, enough to leave them
dangerously contaminated after a few castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of magical energy linked to the caster's own magical
reserves. While the battlesphere cannot take independent action, it will fire
volleys of energy at the caster's enemies in sync with its creator's own
destructive conjurations. With increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer
and deals more damage per volley.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Detonates a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The explosion will hit all
nearby monsters with physical force, knocking them back if damage is done.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

Liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through.
Any movement through liquefied ground will be slowed, and creatures stuck in
the liquefied ground will be unable to fly. Attempts to attack the caster
in melee may fail.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out. Maintaining the
connection to the ground slows the caster's movement, even if they are flying.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

Fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an explosion of
deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is
strongly reduced by armour.

Targets made from rock, stone, ice or bone will cause a small explosion. Metal
targets will cause a small but more damaging explosion, and targets made from
crystal will cause a large and more damaging explosion.
%%%%
Legendary Destruction spell

Conjures two explosive magical effects in instant succession. The effects can
be any mix of Fireball, Iceblast, and Ghostly Fireball.

%%%%
Major Healing spell

%%%%
Malign Gateway spell

Tears a gash in reality, creating a self-sustained but temporary portal to an
unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short
time, a powerful clawed tentacle will reach through the portal, remaining bound
to the caster's will for a duration depending on power. With the portal's
expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster.
%%%%
Malign Offering spell

Drains life from an enemy, healing nearby allies in the process.
%%%%
Malmutate spell

Bestows a mutation on a target. The mutation is almost always harmful. It
cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Manifold Assault spell

Launches melee attacks against multiple visible enemies, warping space into
paradoxical configurations to allow one swing to be in many places. The effect
is too imprecise to allow stabbing unsuspecting foes. At high power, it can be
used to strike more enemies at once.
%%%%
Mara Summon spell

Weaves illusions of the caster. Such illusions have the same physical prowess
as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%
Marshlight spell

Conjures two balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will
rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. Wizards attempted to copy this
with the spell 'Foxfire', but their version is much less powerful.
%%%%
Mass Confusion spell

Causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

Conjures up a short-lived cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Mesmerise spell

Makes a targeted creature unwilling to move away from the caster. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation spell

Lowers the metabolic rate of every creature in the caster's vicinity, slowing
all those who are not resistant to cold. Those especially vulnerable to cold
will be affected much more strongly, and tougher creatures will be slowed for a
shorter time.
%%%%

Fires a directed stream of sharp metal splinters. Its damage is strongly
reduced by armour.
%%%%
Miasma Breath spell

Creates a large cloud of foul pestilence, poisoning and sometimes slowing any
living creatures it touches.
%%%%
Might Other spell

Significantly increases a nearby ally's damage dealt in melee.
%%%%
Might spell

Significantly increases the caster's damage in melee.
%%%%
Mindburst spell

Launches a psychic attack. If it overcomes the victim's willpower, it
'blows their mind' in a violently literal fashion, dealing damage that
bypasses their armour entirely. It is useless against mindless creatures.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

Heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Monstrous Menagerie spell

Summons a powerful exotic creature to the caster's aid: a manticore, a lindwurm,
or, at high power, even a sphinx. Casting the spell at higher power also
increases the strength of the beasts themselves.
%%%%
Necromutation spell

Transforms the caster into a lich — a powerful skeletal figure. The caster
becomes stronger-willed, more resistant to cold and completely immune to
poison, miasma, negative energy, and torment for the duration of the spell.
The caster's necromancy spells are increased in power, and they gain a draining
melee attack. The caster also gains some of the more dubious benefits of having
an undead body, such as a vulnerability to holy damage and Dispel Undead, and
an inability to consume potions.
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

Creates a large cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything in line of sight for as long as the spell lasts.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and a
nascent orb will deal reduced damage.

Residents of the dungeon are able to maintain the orb until it impacts a
target, but when cast by you the orb will dissipate upon leaving your line of
sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

Envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of thick ice, granting a
substantial bonus to armour as long as they remain in their current location.
The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position. The
spell decreases in effectiveness in heavier armour, granting a lower bonus the
higher the encumbrance rating of the caster's armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

Drains heat from the caster and their surroundings, causing harm to all
creatures not resistant to cold and bypassing any armour the targets may have.
It prevents the caster from using potions for a brief duration.

Inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature. The caster
suffers minor damage from the backlash.
%%%%

Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.
%%%%
Paralysis Gaze spell

requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

Opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow instantaneous
transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering them. There is
no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time, but a gateway
will close when entered, or after a moderate amount of time.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock.
It takes some time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which they will
be helpless.
%%%%
Petrify spell

Petrifies a targeted creature. If successful, the target is slowed down for a
while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, the target will
take less damage upon being hit.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.
%%%%
Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Snake Pit, the Spider Nest,
the Swamp, the Shoals, the Pits of Slime, the Elven Halls, the Vaults, the
Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the specific branch varies
with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. Even those
resistant to poison will be poisoned by it, and a small portion of its direct
damage bypasses poison resistance.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Poisonous Vapours spell

Turns the air around a targeted creature poisonous. Exceedingly little poison
is created, generally just enough to poison the target before dispersing.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

Transforms the target into a pig. The target moves swiftly but cannot cast
spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

Allows the caster to teleport fired or thrown missiles directly to their
targets for a short duration, spending an additional small amount of magic for
each missile. Teleported projectiles have their accuracy greatly increased.
%%%%
Primal Wave spell

Conjures a torrent of water that may knock back the target, and creates a
pool of shallow water for a short duration.
%%%%
Pyroclastic Surge spell

Draws searing flames from lava. Any enemies of the caster standing
next to or above lava will be burned.
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

<Breathe Dispelling Energy ability>
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than
penetrating attacks.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Roll spell

Roll into a ball, granting the boulder beetle tremendous speed as well as
double melee damage. The roll may only be performed when at distance from a
foe, and the beetle will always unroll after an attempted roll attack.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Consumes a stone to create a short blast of high-velocity rock shards. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sap Magic spell

Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while
afflicted with this condition may cause the target to lose control over their
magic, progressively hindering their chances of success as more spells are
cast.
%%%%
Scattershot spell

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous piercing ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. So
long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and supplies it with magical
power (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions), the ray will
follow the caster's target if it should move.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature, leaving a cloud of flames at
the endpoint.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

Bestows a strong beacon upon a targeted creature. It announces the presence
and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%

bolt of shadow.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.
%%%%
Shadow Shard spell

Mimics a damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a shard of
shadow.
%%%%
Shatter spell

Causes an enormous burst of concussive force around the caster, dealing severe
damage to all nearby creatures. It is especially effective against those made
from ice, bone, or any wall-like substance (such as rock, metal or crystal), as
well as those turned to stone by petrification. It is less effective against
flying, gelatinous and insubstantial creatures. It may also destroy nearby
walls.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

Creates an icy replica from the corpse of the original being. This magic is
unstable, so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud.
Simulacra cannot leave the level they were created on.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Sleep spell

Puts a targeted creature to sleep. Taking damage will typically wake the
target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

Slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Slug Dart spell

Fires a sharp dart of hardened chitin.
%%%%
Smiting spell

Smites any targeted enemy within sight, with no direct line of fire required.

than the undead. Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will
coalesce from the mist over time.
%%%%
Spellforged Servitor spell

Summons an extraplanar elemental and binds it to a durable shell forged from
the caster's own magic. The servitor is capable of unleashing some of the
destructive spells known to its creator, though the strongest and most volatile
of magics cannot be imbued in this fashion.
%%%%
Spider Form spell

Transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature. The caster becomes
highly evasive and gains a poisonous bite, but gains vulnerability to poison.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded, and casting
spells becomes slightly more difficult.
%%%%

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%
Splinterspray spell

living creatures.

Sprint spell

Causes the caster to move across terrain more rapidly for a short duration.
%%%%
Starburst spell

Releases penetrating bolts of fire from the caster in every direction.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

other adjacent creatures, or back to the caster, before eventually grounding
out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the caster, and bypasses any armour
the target may have.
%%%%
Statue Form spell

Transforms the caster into a slow but extremely robust stone statue. The
caster's melee damage, both unarmed and with weapons, is substantially
increased. The caster's stone body is insulated from electricity and gains
resistance to poison, miasma, and negative energy.

While transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature.
%%%%
Sticky Flame Range spell

Launches a glob of sticky flame, covering a targeted creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

Conjures a glob of sticky flame, covering an adjacent creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a tornado from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration to
maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.
%%%%
Sting spell

Briefly transforms one of the caster's limbs into a long insectoid stinger,
which lashes out at the target. The stinger's impact will always poison a
susceptible target. Even resistant targets have a chance to be poisoned and
immune monsters will be damaged by the physical impact of the stinger.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

Fires a sharp spine of rock.
%%%%
Strip Willpower spell

Greatly reduces the target's willpower, making them more vulnerable to a
variety of magical effects.
%%%%

but never directly lethal. The efficiency of the conversion increases with the
spell's power.

%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

Calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster.

%%%%

Throws a harmful yet strangely delicious pie that can inflict its victim with a
number of debilitating temporary effects. These include inducing vertigo,
silence, fire vulnerability, stat drain, or an aversion to drinking potions.
The dreaded moon pie can even turn you into a bat, a hog, or an insubstantial
wisp!
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

Creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe spell

Entombs the caster within walls of rock. These walls will push away objects in
their way, but their growth is obstructed by the presence of any creature. They
are not permanent, and will expire after a period of time.
%%%%
Tornado spell

Turns the air around the caster into a mighty vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and
tossed around. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the
caster. The vortex is unable to follow the caster through long-distance
translocations. The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed
areas. After the tornado fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short
time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand spell

<Trog's Hand ability>
%%%%
Tukima's Dance spell

Animates the weapon of a targeted foe, ripping it from their hands and causing

and it follows the caster. After the vortex fades, it cannot be called forth
again for a short time.
%%%%
Wall of Brambles spell

Causes brambles to rapidly grow nearby. They have almost no structural
strength, but the wicked thorns they bear make their removal difficult. Such
brambles are sparse enough that almost any missile can pass through unhindered.

%%%%
Waterstrike spell

Causes the water around or under the target to violently swirl, dealing damage.

Irresistably weakens a creature's melee attacks for a period of time,
requiring line of sight but not not line of fire.
%%%%
Wereblood spell

Transforms some of the caster's blood into that of a were-beast. Each
non-summoned enemy the caster slays in combat quickens the pulse and
temporarily enhances their melee and ranged effectiveness. The thrill of
slaying gives the caster an uncontrollable urge to howl.

caster's blood calms the were-spirit and resets the bonus.
%%%%

Causes a strong gust of wind, pushing away creatures and clouds in a cone.
