%%%%
Abjuration

This spell attempts to send hostile summoned creatures to the place from whence they came, or at least shorten their stay in the caster's locality. 
%%%%
Agony

This spell cuts the resilience of a target creature in half, although it will never cause death directly. 
%%%%
Air Walk

This spell transforms the caster's body into an insubstantial cloud. The caster becomes immaterial and nearly immune to physical harm, but is vulnerable to magical fire and ice. While insubstantial the caster is, of course, unable to interact with physical objects (but may still cast spells). 
%%%%
Airstrike

This spell causes the air around a creature to twist itself into a whirling vortex of meteorological fury. This spell is especially effective against flying enemies.
%%%%
Alistair's Intoxication

This spell works by converting a small portion of brain matter into alcohol. It affects all intelligent humanoids within the caster's view (presumably including the caster). It is frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties. 
%%%%
Alter Self

This spell causes aberrations to form in the caster's body, leaving the caster in a weakened state (though it is not fatal in and of itself). It may fail to affect those who are already heavily mutated. 
%%%%
Animate Dead

This spell causes the dead to rise up and serve the caster; every corpse within a certain distance of the caster is affected. By means of this spell, powerful casters could press into service an army of the mindless undead. Note that zombies are incapable of leaving the level they were created on via stairs.
%%%%
Animate Skeleton

This spell raises an inert skeleton to a state of unlife. Note that skeletons are incapable of leaving the level they were created on via stairs.
%%%%
Apportation

This spell allows the caster to pull the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor near the caster. The mass of the target item(s) will make the task more difficult, with some items too massive to ever be moved by this spell. Using this spell on a group of items can be risky; insufficient power will cause some of the items to be lost in the infinite void.
%%%%
Arc

This spell zaps at random a nearby creature with a powerful electrical current.
%%%%
Banishment

This spell banishes one creature to the Abyss. This magic cannot be used to relocate the caster.

%%%%
Berserker Rage

This spell sends the caster into a temporary psychotic rage. 
%%%%

%%%%
Bolt of Cold

This spell hurls a great bolt of ice and frost. 
%%%%
Bolt of Draining

%%%%
Bolt of Fire

This spell hurls a great bolt of flames. 
%%%%
Bolt of Inaccuracy

This spell inflicts enormous damage upon any creature struck by the bolt of incandescent energy conjured into existence. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to aim and very rarely hits anything. Pity, that. 
%%%%
Bolt of Iron

This spell hurls a large and heavy metal bolt at the caster's foes. 
%%%%
Bolt of Magma

This spell hurls a sizzling bolt of molten rock. 
%%%%
Bone Shards

This spell uses the bones of a skeleton to dispense a lethal spray of slicing fragments, allowing its caster to dispense with conjurations in favour of necromancy alone to provide a low-level yet very powerful offensive spell.  The use of a large and heavy skeleton (by wielding it) amplifies this spell's effect.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification

This spell instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently lessens his or her resilience to injury - to a degree dependent on (and inversely related to) magical skill. 
%%%%
Burn

This spell burns a creature. 
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar

%%%%
Cigotuvi's Degeneration

This spell transforms one creature into a pulsating mass of flesh. 
%%%%
Condensation Shield

This spell causes a disc of dense vapour to condense out of the air surrounding the caster. It acts like a normal shield, but its density (and therefore stopping power) depends upon the caster's skill with Ice Magic. The disc is controlled by the caster's mind and thus will not conflict with the wielding of a two-handed weapon. 
%%%%
Confuse

This spell induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind. 
%%%%
Confusing Touch

This spell enchants the caster's hands with magical energy. This energy is released when the caster touches a monster with their bare hands, and may induce a state of confusion in the monster. 
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning

This spell allows the conjurer to create ball lightning. Using the spell is not without risk - ball lightning can be difficult to control. 
%%%%
Conjure Flame

This spell creates a column of roaring flame. 
%%%%
Control Teleport

This spell allows the caster to control translocations. Be wary that controlled teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy. 
%%%%

This spell attempts to enslave any undead in the vicinity of the caster. 
%%%%
Controlled Blink

This spell allows short-range translocation, with precise control. Be wary that controlled teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy. 
%%%%
Corona

This spell causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature. This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and thereby makes the affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corpse Rot

This spell rapidly accelerates the decomposition of any corpses lying around the caster, emitting in the process a foul miasmic vapour, which eats away at the life force of any creature it envelops. 
%%%%

This spell causes a loud noise to be heard. 
%%%%
Crush

This spell crushes a nearby creature with waves of gravitational force. 
%%%%
Cure Poison

%%%%
Death Channel

This spell raises living creatures slain by the caster into a state of unliving slavery as spectral things. Note that spectral things are incapable of leaving the level they were created on via stairs.
%%%%
Death's Door

This spell is extremely powerful, but carries a degree of risk. It renders living casters nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but
can bring them dangerously close to death. So close in fact, that the body believes itself to be dead - healing effects will confuse and paralyze the caster, while cancelling the spell.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. Being more skilled at Necromancy leaves the caster more resilent. Undead cannot use this spell.
%%%%
Debugging Ray

A ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles

This spell protects the caster from any kind of projectile attack, although particularly powerful attacks (lightning bolts, etc.) are deflected to a lesser extent than lighter missiles. 
%%%%

Successfully casting this spell gives the caster the ability to instantaneously release a fireball at a later time. Knowing this spell allows the learner to memorise Fireball for no additional spell levels.

%%%%
Detect Traps

This spell reveals traps in the caster's vicinity. 
%%%%
Dig

This spell digs a tunnel through unworked rock.

This spell temporarily infuses the weapon held by the caster with the essence of pain itself. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Extension

This spell extends the duration of most enchantments affecting the caster.
%%%%
Far Strike

This spell allows the caster to transfer the force of a weapon strike to any target the caster can see. This spell will only deliver the impact of the blow; magical side-effects and enchantments cannot be transferred in this way. The force transferred by this spell has little to do with one's skill with weapons, and more to do with personal strength, translocation skill, and magic ability. 
%%%%
Fire Brand

This spell sets a weapon held by the caster ablaze. It will not affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments. 
%%%%
Fire Storm

This spell creates a mighty storm of roaring flame. 
%%%%

%%%%
Flame Tongue

This spell creates a short burst of flame.
%%%%
Flight

This spell grants to the caster the ability to fly through the air. 
%%%%

%%%%
Fragmentation

This spell creates a concussive explosion within a large body of rock (or other hard material), to the detriment of any who happen to be standing nearby. 
%%%%

%%%%
Freezing Cloud

This spell conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour. 
%%%%
Fulsome Distillation

%%%%
Greater Healing

This spell heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body. 
%%%%
Haste

This spell speeds the actions of a creature. 
%%%%
Heal Other

%%%%
Holy Word

This spell involves the intonation of a word of power which repels and can destroy unholy creatures. 
%%%%
Ice Bolt

This spell throws forth a chunk of ice. It is particularly effective against those creatures not immune to the effects of freezing. But as most of its destructive potential comes from strong impact and cutting edges, even cold-resistant creatures are notably affected. 
%%%%
Ice Form

This spell temporarily transforms the caster's body into a frozen ice-creature. 
%%%%
Ice Storm

This spell conjures forth a raging blizzard of ice, sleet and freezing gasses. 
%%%%
Identify

This spell allows the caster to determine the properties of an otherwise inscrutable magic item. 
%%%%
Ignite Poison

%%%%
Invisibility

This spell hides a creature from the sight of others. 
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast

Metabolic Englaciation

This spell tries to lower the metabolic rate of every creature within the caster's view enough to induce hypothermic hibernation. It may have side effects on cold-blooded creatures. 
%%%%
Necromutation

%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance

This spell bathes the caster's surroundings in poisonous green light. 
%%%%
Orb of Electrocution

This spell hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy which explodes with immense force on impact. 
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour

This spell envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of ice, the power of which depends on his or her skill with ice magic. The caster and the caster's equipment are protected from the cold, but the spell will not function for casters already wearing heavy armour. The effects of this spell are boosted if the caster is in ice form. 
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration

This spell drains the heat from the caster and his or her surroundings, causing harm to all creatures not resistant to cold. 
%%%%
Pain

%%%%
Paralyse

This spell prevents a creature from moving. 
%%%%
Passwall

This spell tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock. This can be dangerous, since it is possible for the spell to expire while the caster is en route, and it also takes time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which time they will be helpless. 
%%%%
Petrify

This spell attempts to petrify a monster. If successful, the monster is slowed down for a while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, a monster will take less damage upon being hit.
%%%%
Poison Ammunition

This spell envenoms missile ammunition held by the caster.

Poison Arrow

This spell hurls a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. No living thing is completely immune to its effects, and even the undead will take damage from the physical component of the spell.

%%%%
Poisonous Cloud

This spell conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gasses.

%%%%

%%%%
Purification

Regeneration

This spell dramatically but temporarily increases the caster's recuperative abilities, while also increasing the rate of food consumption. 
%%%%
Remove Curse

This spell removes curses from any items which are being used by the caster.

%%%%
Ring of Flames

This spell surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of searing flame, and keeps other fire clouds away from the caster. This spell attunes the caster to the forces of fire, increasing their fire magic and giving protection from fire. However, it also makes them much more susceptible to the forces of ice. 
%%%%
Rotting

This spell causes the flesh of all those near the caster to rot. It will affect the living and many of the corporeal undead. 
%%%%
Sandblast

This spell creates a short blast of high-velocity particles. It works best when the caster provides some source (by wielding a stone), but will do what it can with whatever ambient grit is available.

%%%%
Selective Amnesia

This spell allows the caster to selectively erase one spell from memory to recapture the magical energy bound up with it. 
%%%%
Shadow Creatures

This spell weaves a creature from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter. The creature thus brought into existence will recreate some type of creature found in the caster's immediate vicinity. The spell even creates appropriate equipment for the creature, which are given a lasting substance by their firm contact with reality. 
%%%%
Shatter

This spell causes a burst of concussive force around the caster, which will damage most creatures, although those composed of stone, metal or crystal, or otherwise brittle, will particularly suffer. The magic has been known to adversely affect walls. 
%%%%
Shock

This spell throws a bouncing bolt of electricity.
%%%%
Silence

This spell eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting spells, praying or yelling in the caster's vicinity impossible. (Applies to caster too, of course.) This spell will not hide your presence, since its oppressive, unnatural effect will almost certainly alert any living creature that something is very wrong. 
%%%%
Simulacrum

This spell uses a piece of flesh in hand to create a replica of the original being out of ice. This magic is unstable so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud, if it isn't hacked or melted into a small puddle of water first. Note that simulacra are incapable of leaving the level they were created on via stairs.
%%%%
Slow

This spell slows the actions of a creature. 
%%%%
Smiting

This spell smites one creature of the caster's choice. 
%%%%
Spider Form

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature. Spellcasting is slightly more difficult in this form. This spell is not powerful enough to allow the caster to meld with their cursed equipment.
%%%%
Static Discharge

This spell releases electric charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to adjacent monsters (or even the caster) before they eventually ground out. 
%%%%
Statue Form

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a slow-moving (but extremely robust) stone statue.

%%%%
Sting

This spell throws a magical dart of poison. 
%%%%
Stone Arrow

This spell hurls a sharp spine of rock outward from the caster. 
%%%%
Stonemail

This spell covers the caster with chunky scales of stone, the durability of which depends on his or her skill with Earth magic. These scales can coexist with other forms of armour, but are in and of themselves extremely heavy and cumbersome. The effects of this spell are increased if the caster is in Statue Form. 
%%%%
Stoneskin

This spell hardens one's skin to a degree determined by one's skill in Earth Magic. This only works on relatively normal flesh; it will aid neither the undead nor the bodily transformed. The effects of this spell are boosted if the caster is in Statue Form. 
%%%%
Striking

This spell hurls a small bolt of force. 
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood

This spell converts flesh, blood, and other bodily fluids into magical energy. Casters may focus this spell on their own bodies (which can be dangerous but never directly lethal) or can wield freshly butchered flesh in order to draw power into themselves.

%%%%
Summon Demon

This spell opens a gate to the realm of Pandemonium and draws forth one of its inhabitants to serve the caster for a time. 
%%%%
Summon Dragon

This spell summons and binds a powerful dragon to perform the caster's bidding. Beware, for the summons may succeed even as the binding fails. 
%%%%
Summon Elemental

This spell calls forth a spirit from the elemental planes to aid the caster. A large quantity of the desired element must be available; this is rarely a problem for earth and air, but may be for fire or water. The elemental will usually be friendly to casters - especially those skilled in the appropriate form of elemental magic.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon

This spell calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster. Beware, for the spell binding it to service may not outlast that which binds it to this world! 
%%%%
Summon Horrible Things

This spell opens a gate to the Abyss and calls through one or more hideous abominations from that dreadful place. The powers who answer this invocation require of casters a portion of their intellect in exchange for this service.

%%%%
Summon Scorpions

This spell summons one or more giant scorpions to the caster's assistance.

Swiftness

This spell imbues its caster with the ability to achieve great movement speeds. Flying spellcasters can move even faster.
%%%%
Symbol of Torment

This spell calls on the powers of Hell to cause agonising injury to any living thing in the caster's vicinity. It carries within itself a degree of danger, for any brave enough to invoke it, for the Symbol also affects its caller and indeed will not function if he or she is immune to its terrible effects. Despite its ominous power, this spell is never lethal. 
%%%%
Tame Beasts

This spell attempts to tame animals in the caster's vicinity. It works best on animals amenable to domestication. 
%%%%

%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe

This spell entombs the caster within four walls of rock. These walls will destroy most objects in their way, but their growth is obstructed by the presence of any creature. Beware - only the unwise cast this spell without reliable means of escape. 
%%%%
Tukima's Dance

This spell causes a weapon held in the caster's hand to dance into the air and strike the caster's enemies. It will not function on magical staves and certain willful artefacts. 
%%%%
Tukima's Vorpal Blade

This spell bestows a lethal but temporary sharpness on a sword held by the caster. It will not affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments. 
%%%%
Twist

This spell causes a slight spatial distortion around a monster in line of sight of the caster, causing injury.

Vampiric Draining

This spell steals the life of a living creature and grants it to the caster. Life will not be drained in excess of what the caster can capably absorb. 
%%%%
Venom Bolt

This spell throws a bolt of poison. 
%%%%
Warp Weapon

This spell temporarily binds a localized warp field to the invoker's weapon.
%%%%
