directly lethal.
%%%%
Agony spell

Cuts the health of a target creature in half. This damage is never directly

Causes the air around a creature to twist itself into a whirling vortex of
meteorological fury. It does more damage to targets surrounded by empty space.
%%%%
Alistair's Intoxication spell

Converts a small portion of the brain matter of those around you into alcohol,
attempting to confuse all intelligent creatures within view (although
poison-resistant creatures may resist the effects). The caster will experience
vertigo briefly if they successfully make contact with other minds. It is
frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Alistair's Walking Alembic spell

Constructs a mobile and combat-capable alchemical manufactory. It uses the
friction of melee combat to brew a variety of useful potions, venting clouds of
their toxic byproducts at whatever it punches. When it has built up enough heat
to complete its synthesis, it will automatically dispense the finished potions
to nearby allies before falling apart.
%%%%
Anguish spell

Afflicts nearby foes with supernatural anguish, causing all damage they deal to
rebound on them for the duration of the effect. Strong-willed foes can resist the
necromantic visions of pain and suffering, and mindless creatures are unaffected.
%%%%
Animate Dead spell

For some time after casting this, living creatures killed by the caster will rise
as zombies. The chance of reanimating a monster and the duration of the effect
increase with spell power. Re-casting this spell will return zombies to dust, as
will leaving the floor.
%%%%
Apportation spell

Pulls the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor
near the caster. With low power, items might not be moved all the way to the
caster's position.

Extremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist
the pull of this spell.
%%%%
Arcjolt spell

Sends a wave of electricity through everything adjacent or near-adjacent to
the caster. The electricity continues to arc through everything in a connected
chain, though the caster themself is unaffected. The damage dealt bypasses half
of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Avatar Song spell

Sings a powerfully haunting song; in addition to making nearby victims
unwilling to move away from the singer, it calls forth drowned souls from
any nearby bodies of deep water.
%%%%
Awaken Armour spell

Draws upon the memory of your worn armour to manifest an echo of it that fights
alongside you. This echo moves slowly, but the power of its blows increases
dramatically with the weight of the armour used to form it. It possesses all
the defensive properties of the armour itself.

Spellpower increases its durability.
%%%%
Awaken Forest spell

Gives some limited motility to nearby trees, allowing them to sway their
branches and shift their roots. Such enchanted trees will lash at any adjacent
enemy.
%%%%

Causes vines to grow from the ground. The vines will reach out and grab
interlopers, dragging them towards any nearby trees.
%%%%
Banishment spell

Banishes a creature into the Abyss.

Inspires nearby allies of the caster to fight more aggressively, increasing
the strength of their blows.

by willpower.

Translocates the caster to a location further away from a targeted enemy, but
still within sight of the target.

Randomly translocates the caster a short distance. After translocating in this

Transforms the caster into a lightning bolt, and translocates the caster to
the bolt's destination.

creature it strikes.
%%%%

resistance.
%%%%
Bombard spell

Blasts an iron ball toward a target. The force of the blast often sends the
caster staggering backwards.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently
damages their health, to a degree dependent on (and inversely related to) power.

It is powerful enough to cancel the effects of Death's Door, although doing so
will briefly paralyse the caster. It has no effect on the undead.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Vile Clutch spell

Calls forth hands from corpses interred beneath the dungeon floor long ago.
Enemies caught in the area will be held in place and constricted until they
break free.
%%%%
Brain Bite spell

Drains a small amount of a visible enemy's mind and a proportion of their magic,
with no direct line of fire required. If the enemy has near-emptied magic
reserves, they will take doubled damage.
%%%%
Brom's Barrelling Boulder spell

Unleashes a massive rolling boulder in a given compass direction. This boulder
damages any creature it hits, rolling over those who perish beneath it and
pushing any others helplessly backwards (along with anyone else unfortunate
enough to be standing behind them).

Its size and reckless locomotion make it difficult to use in confined areas; if
lauched down narrow passages, it will rapidly abrade against the walls and fall
apart. It will also crumble if it leaves the caster's sight or strikes a wall
or otherwise unmoveable creature.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms spell

<Brothers in Arms ability>
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar spell

Summons an inugami to the caster's aid. These mystical canines form a bond with
their summoner, strengthening them in direct proportion with the caster's
spellpower.

Recasting this spell while your familiar is nearby will imbue it with additional
magic, mending some of its wounds and causing its next attack to strike more
quickly and cleave adjacent foes.
%%%%
Call Down Damnation spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation, with no direct line of fire required.
These unholy forces harm the victim and anyone adjacent, and are not affected
by any means of protection, such as armour or resistances. However, certain
creatures, usually those able to invoke damnation themselves, are entirely
unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Call Down Lightning spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with lightning, with no direct line of fire required.
The targeting magics need distance to function, so enemies that are adjacent
or nearly adjacent cannot be struck by this.
%%%%
Call Imp spell

Calls forth a minor demon from the pits of Hell, equipped with a spear with
which to jab at the caster's enemies. The quality of the imp's weaponry rises
with spell power.
%%%%
Call Lost Souls spell

Summons some necromantic spectres. These lost souls can enter the bodies of more
powerful undead to bring them back from brink of demise, or turn dying living
creatures into ghostly versions of themselves.
%%%%
Call of Chaos spell

Calls upon the powers of chaos to empower nearby allies, granting them haste,
might, doubled health, or improved resistances. The chaotic magic may
occasionally backfire and cause allies to instead lose their willpower or be
berserked, polymorphed, or filled with inner flame.
%%%%
Call Tide spell

Allows the caster to affect the tidal phase of all water within a large
distance. Soon after calling it, the waters on the whole level will reach high
tide. Waters near the caster will reach even higher levels than they would
normally.
%%%%
Cantrip spell

Casts one of a number of minor spells, aimed at trying to bolster the caster's
morale. They have no noticeable effect.
%%%%
Cause Fear spell

Causes fear in those near to the caster, causing those affected to be unable to
approach the caster, and to sometimes fail to attack them in melee. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Caustic Breath spell

<Caustic Breath ability>
%%%%
Chain of Chaos spell

Creates an arc of pure chaos, striking nearby creatures with unpredictable
effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.
%%%%
Chain Lightning spell

Releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs to the creature nearest the
caster and then outward from it. The further it travels, the less damage it
does. Secondary arcs have limited range and do little damage to the caster.
The spell bypasses half of defenders' armour and resistance to electricity.
%%%%
Charm spell

Causes an otherwise hostile creature to fight on the caster's side for a while.
Adventurers, set on their quest for the ORB, instead suffer momentary confusion.
%%%%
Chaos Breath spell

Exhales a large cloud of fumes filled with the very essence of chaos.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Putrefaction spell

Magically accelerates the decay of damaged living tissue, causing great clouds
of miasma to billow forth from a targeted victim's wounds over several turns
which may slow and heavily poison any living creature who stands in them. Air
currents will prevent this pestilence from forming wherever the caster is
standing, but they are not otherwise protected from its effects.

This spell may only be cast on a living creature who is at least heavily
wounded, and channelling such necrotic energies will leave the caster's own
health temporarily drained (though spellpower will reduce the intensity of this
side-effect).
%%%%
Cleansing Flame spell

Invokes a huge blast of divine fury centered on the user, severely damaging
undead and demons and dealing damage to all other hostile creatures.
%%%%
Cold Breath spell

Exhales a focused blast of icy-cold air.
%%%%
Concentrate Venom spell

Intensifies the natural venom of the target monster. Poisonous bites and spit
become intense enough to slow and asphyxiate.
%%%%
Combustion Breath spell

<Combustion Breath ability>
%%%%
Confuse spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch spell

Enchants the caster's dominant hand with magical energy. This energy is
released when the caster touches a monster, and may induce a state of confusion
in the monster. The caster's attacks do no damage while attempting to touch a
monster in this way.
%%%%
Confusion Gaze spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind, with no
direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. The damage dealt bypasses half of
defenders' armour. Casters are advised to use caution; the lightning is not
mindful of what it may hit.

The magic which keeps ball lightnings cohesive has limited range, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if allowed to drift too far away from their caster before
exploding.
%%%%
Conjure Living Spells spell

Creates several living, autonomous spells, which cast themselves at the first foe
to enter their range. Once cast, they dissipate.
%%%%
Construct Spike Launcher spell

Constructs a simple mechanical trap within an adjacent wall which repeatedly
skewers random adjacent enemies. Protected by the wall itself, it is
invulnerable to most forms of damage, but will fall apart if the caster leaves
its vicinity.
%%%%
Corona spell

Causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature.
This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and makes the
affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corrosive Bolt spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of acid.
%%%%
Corrupt spell

Unleashes Abyssal energies in the immediate vicinity. This changes the
appearance of the affected area and temporarily summons creatures from the
Abyss. This cannot be used in the Abyss itself.
%%%%
Corrupting Pulse spell

Instills a corruption within all visible targets, temporarily mutating their
bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the
undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Creeping Frost spell

Calls forth freezing cold from the walls. Any enemies of the caster standing
next to the walls will be frozen and will find their movements slowed. Cold
resistance will reduce damage, but not prevent the freezing effect.
%%%%
Creeping Shadow spell

Calls forth shadows from the corners of nearby walls to strike at all of the
caster's enemies standing adjacent to them.
%%%%
Crystallizing Shot spell

Hurls a large and heavy shard of crystal. It may render a creature's body
structure as brittle and fragile as shattered and unrefined crystal, increasing
the damage they take from all sources.
%%%%
Curse of Agony spell

Curses a foe, halving their remaining health after each of the next two times
that the caster strikes them in melee.
%%%%
Dazzling Flash spell

The caster erupts in a scintillating display of light. Any living, demonic
or angelic creature nearby may be dazzled and left stumbling blindly.
%%%%
Death Channel spell

Binds the souls of slain living, demonic and holy creatures, forcing their
spectres to remain and fight for the caster for as long as the channel lasts.
%%%%
Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left further from death when the effect ends. It has no effect on those
who are already undead.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

Fires a ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Diamond Sawblades spell

Forges up to four razor-sharp sawblades at fixed positions around the caster
which shred any enemies adjacent to them over several turns.
%%%%
Dig spell

Digs a tunnel through unworked rock.
%%%%
Dimension Anchor spell

Blocks any translocations attempted by the affected target, be they voluntary
or not. This includes even some cross-plane effects, although notably not
Banishment.
%%%%
Dimensional Bullseye spell

Weaves a link between the caster's weaponry and a chosen target. Whenever the
caster fires or throws something at a *different* enemy, a matching projectile
will be teleported at the target. Spellpower increases their accuracy.
%%%%
Discord spell

Drives nearby creatures into an wild frenzy, causing them to mercilessly
attack anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

Destabilises the space in a sphere around the caster for a while, causing
anyone nearby to blink away from the caster. The chance of blinking depends on
the distance from the caster, being nearly certain when directly adjacent.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

Harms an adjacent undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces
binding it together.
%%%%
Dispel Undead Range spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

Teleports away any creatures within a short distance of the caster. Any
creature with the Will to resist will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a separate Will-based chance
of being confused by the warping of space.
%%%%
Divine Armament spell

Manifests the caster's faith as a spiritual weapon, which will fight and slay
the caster's enemies under its own power.

As it is a direct reflection of the caster's unique zeal, the weapon they
receive from their god will be the same each time.
%%%%
Dominate Undead spell

Attempts to forcibly change the allegiance of all nearby undead which are not
already loyal to the caster.

Adventurers, being famously headstrong, cannot be fully controlled by this
spell. They will instead lash out randomly for the duration of its effect,
attacking nearby friend and foe alike before regaining their wits.

This spell can be broken prematurely by the death of its caster.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.
%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon
to engage the summoner's enemies. The spell is taxing to maintain, and each new
dragon which answers the call will further drain the summoner's magical
reserves. After the call ends, it cannot be issued again for a short time. The
duration of the call and the species of dragons called depend on spell power.
%%%%
Drain Life spell

Drains the life force of any nearby creatures, healing the user depending on
the damage dealt.
%%%%
Drain Magic spell

Causes the target's magic to leak into the air, as though they were hit by an
antimagic weapon.
%%%%
Draining Gaze spell

Causes the target's magic to leak into the air, as though they were hit by an
antimagic weapon, and heals the caster for the amount of magic drained,
with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Dream Dust spell

Overwhelms the target with soporific dream dust, putting them to sleep with an
enchanting visual display. Additional dream sheep will increase the strength
and duration of this effect.
%%%%
Druid's Call spell

Recalls woodland creatures from elsewhere on the same level.
%%%%
Electrical Bolt spell

Throws a bolt of electricity at the target, with high accuracy.
%%%%
Enfeeble spell

Overwhelms an enemy with malignant energies, irresistibly weakening their melee
attacks and disrupting their magic. It will additionally daze and blind any foe
that fails to resist the full force of the curse.
%%%%
Ensnare spell

Shoots a stream of webbing at a creature, ensnaring the target in a sticky web.
%%%%
Ensorcelled Hibernation spell

Lowers its target's metabolic rate, inducing hibernation. After awakening, the
target will be unable to be put to sleep again for some time.
%%%%
Entropic Weave spell

Corrodes the target, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Eringya's Noxious Bog spell

Causes the caster to release a torrent of sludge that transforms nearby areas
into a toxic bog. The sludge damages and poisons all monsters, even those
resistant to poison. The bog cannot form on areas adjacent to multiple solid
features, nor on areas that lack solid floor, like deep water or lava. The
transformation is temporary and cannot be sustained out of the caster's sight.
Spellpower will increase how long the bog lingers.
%%%%
Eringya's Surprising Crocodile spell

Summons a toothy crocodile to assault an adjacent enemy. The crocodile will
appear beneath the caster in a surge of murky water and perform an empowered
attack against the chosen target, dragging both it and the caster backward
before allowing the latter to dismount safely behind it. It cannot be recast
while the crocodile is still active.
%%%%
Eruption spell

Splits the earth to draw up a localised, short-lived volcano under the target.
%%%%
Fastroot spell

Fires a magical seed, entangling victims in quick-growing tree roots. Those
entangled will be painfully constricted until they escape or the roots wither
away. The roots will only sprout from solid ground.
%%%%
Flay spell

Opens painful illusionary wounds on the target's body, which disappear after
a short time or on the death of the caster. This cannot kill directly, and is
ineffective against unnatural targets.
%%%%
Fire Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Fire Storm spell

Calls forth a mighty storm of roaring flame directly onto the target, dealing
damage in a large area and leaving behind short-lived fire vortices. Half of
its damage bypasses fire resistance.
%%%%
Fire Summon spell

Summons demons of flame and damnation.
%%%%
Fireball spell

Hurls an explosive ball of fire.
%%%%
Flame Wave spell

Blasts the caster's surroundings with a wave of fire. If the caster maintains
focus and supplies the spell with magical power (by waiting in place and not
taking any other actions), more and larger flame waves will radiate outward.
%%%%
Flaming Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of roaring flames.
%%%%
Flash Freeze spell

Freezes the air around a target, causing significant harm and slowing the
target's movement for a short time. Half of its damage bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Flashing Balestra spell

A single soul from within the armoury leaps out, striking with their weapon and
then duelling independently for a short time before returning to the maelstrom
once more.
%%%%
Force Lance spell

Fires a shaft of concussive force. If the impact deals damage, it may knock the
target back. If this knockback causes the target to hit a wall or another
creature, both will take additional damage.
%%%%
Forceful Invitation spell

Summons some creatures from one of the Snake Pit, the Spider Nest, the Swamp,
the Shoals, the Elven Halls, the Vaults, or the Crypt; the specific branch
varies with the caster.
%%%%
Forge Blazeheart Golem spell

Constructs a shell of slag iron around a volatile elemental spark. It is capable
of raining down powerful blows on its creator's adversaries - so powerful that
the golem itself is often damaged by their impact.

Only tenuously independent of its creator's magic, the flames within it will
rapidly go dormant if the two ever leave each other's side. If its shell is
destroyed while the golem is still active, its exposed core will violently
detonate a moment later.

It gains greater explosive damage at higher power.
%%%%
Forge Lightning Spire spell

Constructs an immobile lightning spire at a nearby location. This spire
irregularly discharges bolts of electricity at the caster's foes, prioritizing
whichever of them is most distant from it.
%%%%
Forge Monarch Bomb spell

Constructs a flying incendiary factory, packed to the brim with cluster bomblets
which it can deploy both in melee and launch at range. While the monarch's
bomblets have no attack of their own, they will pursue the caster's enemies
until given the signal to explode.

Recasting this spell while anything created by is still active will detonate the
monarch bomb and all bomblets, dealing a combination of fire and physical damage
to everything adjacent to them besides the caster themselves.
%%%%
Forge Phalanx Beetle spell

Constructs a small mechanical guardian which bolsters its creator's armour
class for as long as it remains adjacent to them.

While also capable of biting foes, the phalanx beetle will never voluntarily
leave its creator's side, and if forcibly separated, will prioritize returning
to them over any other concern.

Spellpower increases the magnitude of the AC increase, as well as the beetle's
own durability.
%%%%
Fortress Blast spell

Draws upon the caster's own physical integrity to create a kinetic shockwave
that damages foes in a large area. The caster is locked in place for several
turns as the shockwave starts to form, and the spell will be cancelled if they
are displaced during that time, but they may otherwise perform other actions
freely.

Spellpower causes the spell to complete more quickly, but the damage depends
entirely upon the caster's AC.
%%%%
Foxfire spell

Conjures two balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will
rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. They will dissipate harmlessly
if unable to reach a target or if the caster swaps places with them.
%%%%
Freeze spell

Freezes an adjacent creature, dealing damage that bypasses any armour the
target may have. This may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.
%%%%
Freezing Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%
Frozen Ramparts spell

Encases surrounding walls with ice for a short time. Foes that wander near the
icy walls will be damaged, and this may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.
Each victim is only ever affected by one icy wall at a time.

The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position.
%%%%
Fugue of the Fallen spell

Calls out to the lingering remnants of the long dead. While active, each
non-summoned enemy the caster or their allies slays attracts more vengeful
souls into the caster's weapon, temporarily enhancing their melee and ranged
effectiveness. When this bonus reaches its maximum, every hit will unleash a
glimmer of the dead's suffering, causing pain damage to each other foe adjacent
to your target.

Recasting this spell will release your grip on the souls you've attracted,
resetting any bonus you've accumulated, and the cacophonous wailing of the dead
may attract unwanted attention even while you maintain it.
%%%%
Fulminant Prism spell

Conjures a shining prism of an unstable soft gold alloy. This is useless as
legal tender, however, as it will unfortunately violently explode with arcane
force after a short duration. If destroyed prematurely, its blast will be much
weaker.
%%%%
Fulsome Fusillade spell

A magnum opus of reckless chemistry, this spell conjures up a surfeit of
volatile reagents to rain down upon your enemies. For the next several turns, up
to 3 random enemies in sight will be struck by an exploding beaker that inflicts
either fire, cold, electric, or poison damage. If any of these explosions
overlap each other, the resulting reaction will inflict even greater
irresistible damage and sometimes apply a random deleterious status on whoever
is caught in the blast.

This spell costs a small amount of the caster's magical energy each turn to
maintain, and while it will never aim an explosion where it could hurt the
caster, the caster's allies (and anything else in the general vicinity) are not
so fortunate.
%%%%
Funeral Dirge spell

A ritual chant that briefly rouses several nearby undead allies to move more
swiftly and strike with greater might.
%%%%
Galvanic Breath spell

<Galvanic Breath ability>
%%%%
Gell's Gavotte spell

Briefly reorients local gravity to be in a cardinal direction of the caster's
choosing, causing all creatures in sight to tumble a short distance in that
direction.

The caster is not immune to the gravitational effects of this spell, but will
be cushioned so they take no collision damage. Other creatures are not so
fortunate, and the abrupt impact will batter anything which was not already
standing beside its new 'floor'.

It takes a short time for gravity to stabilise enough to recast this spell,
though more powerful mages are able to do so more frequently.
%%%%
Ghostly Fireball spell

Hurls an exploding ball of negative energy which drains any living creature
it engulfs.
%%%%
Ghostly Sacrifice spell

Uses an ally's motivating essence to create a blast of negative energy,
draining any living creature it engulfs. The being used to fuel the spell, no
matter whether living or construct, is consumed and unmade in the process.
%%%%
Glacial Breath spell

<Glacial Breath ability>
%%%%
Glaciate spell

Conjures forth a mighty blast of ice. Creatures within its cone-shaped area of
effect take damage, with higher damage being dealt to those close to the
caster. Those hit by the blast are encased in ice, slowing their movement, and
those killed by the blast may be frozen into solid blocks of ice. Half of its
damage bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Grasping Roots spell

Calls giant grasping roots from deep underground that hold and constrict their
victim. The roots will retreat if the victim breaks free or if the caller moves
out of view.
%%%%
Grave Claw spell

Calls forth the spite of the recently dead to skewer a targeted enemy with
shards of bone. This spell never misses, and will pin its target in place for
several turns, but casting it rapidly consumes the remnants of death that linger
upon the caster.

You can stockpile enough malice to cast this spell at most three times, and this
can only be replenished by causing the death of a sufficient number of living
beings.
%%%%
Greater Servant of Makhleb spell

Summons a major demon.
%%%%
Greater Ensnare spell

Shoots a stream of webbing at a creature, ensnaring them in a sticky web and
scattering additional webs nearby that dissolve after a short length of time.
%%%%
Hailstorm spell

Conjures a cannonade of hail, battering nearby creatures that fail to dodge.
The eye of the storm is wide enough that monsters adjacent to the caster are
unaffected. Due to the strong impact and cutting edges, half of its damage
bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Haste Other spell

Speeds the actions of a nearby ally.
%%%%
Harpoon Shot spell

Fires a long and flexible barbed mass. The ensnared victim will either be
pulled adjacent to the caster or collide with anything blocking the way.
%%%%
Haste spell

Speeds the actions of the caster.
%%%%
Haunt spell

Calls wraiths and ghosts to haunt the caster's target. They will only attack
the creature they are haunting, and will dissipate quickly once their target
dies. The number of spectres summoned increases with spell power.
%%%%
Hellfire Mortar spell

Splits apart the ground in front of the caster and sculpts a terrifying weapon
out of molten rock. This mortar will move slowly along the lava-filled chasm,
autonomously launching gouts of magma at the caster's enemies as it does so.

When it reaches the end of its path, or is obstructed in its movement by another
creature, it will sink back into the lava, and the chasm will seal itself shut
shortly thereafter.
%%%%
Heal Other spell

Heals a nearby ally.
%%%%
Hunting Call spell

Inspires nearby allies to quicken their movement.
%%%%
Hurl Damnation spell

<Hurl Damnation ability>
%%%%
Hurl Sludge spell

Conjures a focused blast of highly toxic sludge, poisoning the victim and
drenching their surroundings. The sludge damages and poisons all monsters,
even those resistant to poison.
%%%%
Hoarfrost Bullet spell

Fires a shard of ice that coats whatever it hits with a layer of brittle frost
which slows their movement.

Each shot fired will deplete the cannon's remaining durability, but if it
survives to fire 5 times, the final shot will fragment to hit all enemies around
the primary target for additional damage.
%%%%
Hoarfrost Cannonade spell

Sculpts a pair of icy cannons that assail the caster's enemies from long range.
The frigid shards they fire rapidly coat their targets with a layer of brittle
frost which slows their movement.

The cannons are short-lived and consume a part of themselves with every shard
they fire, but if they survive to fire their final salvo without interference,
it will be extra-powerful.
%%%%
Holy Breath spell

Exhales a large cloud of blessed flame, shining with the glory of the good
gods. These flames are especially dangerous to undead and demonic creatures,
and have no effect on holy creatures.
%%%%
Holy Flames spell

Traps an enemy in a ring of blessed flame. These flames are especially
dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy
creatures.
%%%%
Iceblast spell

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. Half of its damage
bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Ignite Poison spell

Converts all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning poisoned creatures from
within. It also turns clouds of poison and mephitic gases into flame. The
caster is not affected directly.
%%%%
Ignition spell

All foes in the caster's surroundings are engulfed in balls of fire. The caster
and their allies are protected from the fire and will never be harmed by this
spell.

%%%%
Infestation spell

Calls forth a plague of scarabs, infesting affected creatures for a duration
depending on power and causing death scarabs to grow and burst from them upon
death.
%%%%
Injury Bond spell

Binds the caster to nearby allies, redirecting half of any damage they suffer
to the caster.
%%%%
Injury Mirror spell

Reflects damage taken for a short duration, hurting attackers whenever any
damage is taken.
%%%%
Ink Cloud spell

Releases a thick cloud of ink to obscure vision.
%%%%
Inner Flame spell

Fills an enemy with an intense fire. This fire is released any time the target
is hit, and explosively released upon death. The size of the explosion caused
is dependent on the size of the target.
%%%%
Invisibility spell

Turns the caster invisible.
%%%%
Invisibility Other spell

Turns a nearby ally invisible.
%%%%
Iron Shot spell

Hurls a large and heavy metal shot.
%%%%
Irradiate spell

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures. It may heavily deform
its victims, weakening them and reducing their armour. The caster is not left
entirely unaffected; some of the magic lingers, enough to leave them
dangerously contaminated after a few castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of destructive energy. Each time its creator casts a
offensive spell, the battlesphere will also fire an unerring volley of energy at
the most injured nearby foe it can reach.

The battlesphere's creator can freely fire through its position without harming
it.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Detonates a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The explosion will hit all
nearby monsters with physical force, knocking them back if damage is done.
Spellpower increases damage and knockback distance.
%%%%
Jinxbite spell

Calls the attention of trickster spirits. While it holds, the spirits will
follow up on the caster's attacks. If the spell overcomes victims' willpower,
they will suffer minor damage and be drained by the sprites' playful malice.

Fae assistance is fickle, however; they cannot be beckoned unless a susceptible
victim is visible, and will depart rapidly once no more remain. Calling on the
fae also reduces the caster's own willpower for a time.
%%%%
Kinetic Grapnel spell

Weaves a thin kinetic filament around the caster's melee weapon and launches the
other end of it at a nearby enemy. If this grapnel successfully hits and does
damage, it will become lodged in them, allowing the next melee attack the caster
performs against them to strike with perfect accuracy and a small slaying bonus.
%%%%
Volatile Blastmotes spell

Brings forth a cloud of volatile blastmotes around the caster. These explode
on contact with open flame or with creatures - including any caster foolish
enough to linger in them! The explosion is concussive, knocking adjacent
creatures away. Damage done rises with the spell's power.
%%%%
Launch Bomblet spell

Fires a bomblet on a ballistic trajectory that ignores line of fire, dealing
minor damage to a single target within range and deploying the bomblet near it.

Cannot target enemies adjacent to the caster or those with no nearby room for
the bomblet to land.
%%%%
Launch Clockwork Bee spell

Constructs a mechanical bee and winds its clockwork mechanisms over several
turns before unleashing it against a targeted foe. The bee is swift and
powerful, but its clockwork quickly winds down as it attacks, eventually leaving
it helpless and unable to move.

The caster may repair and rewind a dormant bee by attempting to move into it, at
the cost of 1 MP.

Spellpower increases the number of attacks the bee may perform before going
dormant.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

Liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through.
Any movement through liquefied ground will be slowed, and creatures stuck in
the liquefied ground will be unable to fly. Attempts to attack the caster
in melee may fail.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out. Maintaining the
connection to the ground slows the caster's movement, even if they are flying.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

Fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an explosion of
deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is
strongly reduced by armour.

Targets made from rock, stone, ice or bone will cause a small explosion. Metal
targets will cause a small but more damaging explosion, and targets made from
crystal will cause a large and more damaging explosion.
%%%%
Legendary Destruction spell

Conjures two explosive magical effects in instant succession. The effects can
be any mix of Fireball, Iceblast, and Ghostly Fireball.
%%%%
Lehudib's Crystal Spear spell

Hurls a lethally sharp shard of crystal.
%%%%
Lesser Beckoning spell

Beckons the target forward, attempting to place them adjacent to the caster.
%%%%
Lightning Bolt spell

Fires a mighty bolt of lightning. Its damage bypasses half of defenders'
armour, and it can be bounced off walls to hit targets twice.
%%%%
Magic Dart spell

Fires a small bolt of magical energy which never misses.
%%%%
Magma Barrage spell

Fires penetrating bolts of molten rock at up to two different enemy targets.
Half of its damage bypasses fire resistance.
%%%%
Magnavolt spell

Envelops a target in a thin layer of magnetically charged metal fragments, then
unleashes a powerful surge of electricity that arcs unerringly towards every
visible target coated in these fragments - firing an additional beam at each
target thus marked.

Magnetised creatures are additionally unable to evade attacks and will be
revealed if invisible. If they die while still coated, they will leave behind a
short-lived cloud of electrified metal that will continue to serve as a
lightning rod for this spell.
%%%%
Major Destruction spell

Shoots a random harmful beam or explosion at the targeted creature.
%%%%
Major Healing spell

Heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Malign Gateway spell

Tears a gash in reality, creating a self-sustained but temporary portal to an
unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short
time, a powerful clawed tentacle will reach through the portal, remaining bound
to the caster's will for a duration depending on power. With the portal's
expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster. The duration of
the portal increases with spell power.
%%%%
Malign Offering spell

Drains life from an enemy, healing nearby allies in the process.
%%%%
Malmutate spell

Bestows a mutation on a target. The mutation is almost always harmful. It
cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Manifold Assault spell

Warps space into paradoxical configurations to strike many visible foes with
one melee attack. Power increases the number of foes attacked with one cast,
though unarmed attacks strike only half as many targets at once, as additional
care must be taken when warping one's own limbs.

The time taken for the attack is exactly the same as a normal melee attack.
Attacks performed this way never miss, but the exact spot struck cannot be
controlled precisely, making them unable to do extra damage against unsuspecting
foes.
%%%%
Mara Summon spell

Weaves illusions of the caster. Such illusions have the same physical prowess
as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%
March of Sorrows spell

Conjures a stream of stolen suffering, leaving clouds of excruciating misery in
its wake and around its targets. These clouds of negative energy will rapidly
drain the living of small fractions of their maximum health.
%%%%
Marshlight spell

Conjures two balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will
rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. Wizards attempted to copy this
with the spell 'Foxfire', but their version is much less powerful.
%%%%
Martyr's Knell spell

Beckons forth the soul of a long-dead martyr to shield your allies for a time.
This soul suffers a portion of the damage your allies would otherwise receive.

If it is slain (again!), it will transform into a flayed ghost, inflicting
illusory wounds on foes. Such wounds are fleeting, and will disappear when the
ghost departs - unless you kill its victims first.
%%%%
Mass Confusion spell

Causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Mass Regeneration spell

Causes all allied monsters nearby to rapidly regenerate over a short period of
time. This regeneration is proportional to each of those creature's maximum
health.
%%%%
Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling spell

Gradually builds up electric charge in the caster, so long as they maintain
focus (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions). When a threshold
is reached, the charge couples with the nearest foe, vaporising them instantly.
Higher spell power will allow the caster to accumulate charge more rapidly.
%%%%
Maxwell's Portable Piledriver spell

Compresses an envelope of space around the caster and an adjacent enemy (or a
contiguous line of enemies), then allows it to decompress abruptly, propelling
everyone forward until the unfortunate being at the far end collides with
something solid, inflicting damage on them proportional to the distance
travelled.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

Conjures a fragile flask that explodes into short-lived clouds of noxious fumes.
These clouds may cause confusion in any creature not resistant to poison.
Tougher, more experienced creatures are less likely to be affected.
%%%%
Mesmerise spell

Makes a targeted creature unwilling to move away from the caster. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation spell

Lowers the metabolic rate of every creature in the caster's vicinity, slowing
all those who are not resistant to cold. Cold-blooded creatures will be
affected much more strongly, and tougher creatures will be slowed for a
shorter time.
%%%%
Metal Splinters spell

Fires a burst of metal splinters. Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Miasma Breath spell

Creates a large cloud of foul pestilence, poisoning and sometimes slowing any
living creatures it touches.
%%%%
Might Other spell

Significantly increases a nearby ally's damage dealt in melee.
%%%%
Might spell

Significantly increases the caster's damage in melee.
%%%%
Mindburst spell

Launches a psychic attack. If it overcomes the victim's willpower, it
'blows their mind' in a violently literal fashion, dealing damage that
bypasses their armour entirely. It is useless against mindless creatures.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

Heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Monstrous Menagerie spell

Summons a powerful exotic creature to the caster's aid: a manticore, a lindwurm,
or, at high power, even a guardian sphinx. Casting the spell at higher power
also increases the strength of the beasts themselves.
%%%%
Mercury Arrow spell

Conjures an arrow of elemental mercury which deals direct poison damage to
whatever it hits and may also weaken their melee attacks for a short while.

The physical force of the arrow inflicts a small amount of damage even to those
immune to poison, and the weakening effect can splash to adjacent targets and
ignores poison resistance altogether.
%%%%
Mourning Wail spell

Exhales a stream of forgotten grief, leaving clouds of excruciating misery in
its wake but skipping past creatures that would be vulnerable to it. These
clouds of negative energy will rapidly drain the living of small fractions of
their maximum health.
%%%%
Mud Breath spell

<Mud Breath ability>
%%%%
Nazja's Percussive Tempering spell

Manifests a magical hammer that repairs and temporarily augments the offensive
capabilities of any construct that was created by the caster's own Forgecraft
spells. This process results in a flurry of sparks, slag, and concussive
shockwaves that do considerable damage to any enemies adjacent to the targeted
construct, but it cannot be recast upon the same object until the enhancement
wears off.
%%%%
Noxious Breath spell

<Noxious Breath ability>
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

Creates a large cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Nullifying Breath spell

<Nullifying Breath ability>
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything in line of sight for as long as the spell lasts.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilise, and a
nascent orb will deal reduced damage.

Residents of the dungeon are able to maintain the orb until it impacts a
target, but when cast by you the orb will dissipate upon leaving your line of
sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

Envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of thick ice, granting a
substantial bonus to armour as long as they remain in their current location.
The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position. The
spell decreases in effectiveness in heavier armour, granting a lower bonus the
higher the encumbrance rating of the caster's armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

Turns the air bitterly cold, freezing all other creatures in line of sight.
This is less effective against creatures packed tightly together - those
adjacent to others will be partly insulated from the cold, taking less damage.
%%%%
Pain spell

Inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.
%%%%
Paralysis Gaze spell

Irresistibly prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time,
requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

Opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow instantaneous
transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering them. There is
no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time. However,
gateways close a short time after being opened, or immediately once entered.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Allows the caster to travel a short distance through an adjacent rock wall and
emerge again on the other side. This spell takes an unusally long time to cast,
during which the caster will be unable to act, but also gain increased armour
from their attunement to the rock.
%%%%
Permafrost Eruption spell

Calls on the ancient cold lurking within the earth to emerge - violently. The
force of its emergence blasts rock from the ceiling, smashing into the target
with unavoidable force. The cold itself is brief but unbearably bitter,
bypassing armour entirely as it freezes the target and their neighbours.

It will always attempt to blast the largest concentration of foes in sight, and
never explodes next to the caster.
%%%%
Petrify spell

Petrifies a targeted creature and up to two other foes in a chain. Those which
do not muster the Will to resist are briefly slowed, and then turned to stone.
Until they return to flesh, they are unable to act, but also take half damage.
The spell's power is lessened against secondary targets.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Blitz spell

Weaves and fires a phantom copy of the caster with great force. Such phantoms
have the same martial and mystic prowess as the caster, and an impromptu night
parade of illusions may overwhelm the caster's victims.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.
%%%%
Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Pits of Slime, the Elven
Halls, the Vaults, the Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the
specific branch varies with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Plasma Beam spell

Fires a penetrating beam of plasma at one of the caster's most distant foes.
The ionised beam bypasses half of defenders' armour, and a second beam of fire
follows in its wake.
%%%%
Platinum Paragon spell

Constructs a gleaming metal champion whose prowess rivals that of the greatest
living warriors. It is resistant to all forms of magic and wields a perfect
replica of any artefact melee weapon the caster chooses.

It creates a damaging shockwave around itself when first deployed and slowly
gains charge as it attacks enemies. When it has gained sufficient charge, the
spell may be recast to overload the paragon, unleashing a flurry of attacks
in a wide area which inflict increased damage, but destroying the paragon in the
process.

Due to the magical link it maintains with its creator, it will perform an
extra attack whenever they do, and will sometimes even parry attacks directed at
them, if they are close enough together.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. Even those
resistant to poison will be poisoned by it, and a small portion of its direct
damage bypasses poison resistance.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Poisonous Vapours spell

Transmutes a small amount of the air around a target into toxic vapours,
poisoning anyone unfortunate enough to breathe them in. The quantity of air
affected is small and it will not persist beyond the turn in which it is cast.

It cannot affect those with any resistance to poison.
%%%%
Polar Vortex spell

Turns the air around the caster into a freezing vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it that can only be half-mitigated by resistance to
cold. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and tossed around.
Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the caster. The
vortex is unable to follow the caster through long-distance translocations.
The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After the
vortex fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

Transforms the target into a pig. The target moves swiftly but cannot cast
spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

Teleports a fired or thrown missile at a targeted enemy.
%%%%
Prayer of Brilliance spell

Empowers the magic of nearby wizard allies of the caster, allowing them to
cast their magic more powerfully and more often.
%%%%
Primal Wave spell

Conjures a torrent of water that may knock back the target, and creates a
pool of shallow water for a short duration.
%%%%
Pyre Arrow spell

Launches a glob of liquid fire that clings to a targeted creature, dealing
armour-ignoring fire damage over multiple turns. The victim can put the fire out
much more quickly by moving.

If the target is insubstantial, the liquid fire will fail to stick.
%%%%
Pyroclastic Surge spell

Draws searing flames from lava. Any enemies of the caster standing
next to or above lava will be burned.
%%%%
Pyrrhic Recollection spell

Ignites a memory from the nimbus which surrounds Nobody, temporarily granting
them the knowledge of a powerful spell and healing their injuries.

This power is fleeting and will be extinguished after taking any significant
amount of damage, but so long as any other memories remain, they cannot be
put to rest for good.
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

Fires a bolt of dispelling energy at a targeted creature, possibly removing
some of its enchantments.
%%%%
Ravenous Swarm spell

Unleashes a torrent of vampire bats, filling the air around a target.

These vampires will gnaw on anything which isn't undead with a voracious hunger,
and their bites will eventually even lull their victims to sleep, leaving them
easy prey.
%%%%
Rebounding Blaze spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of energetic flames that can bounce off walls to hit
targets twice.
%%%%
Rebounding Chill spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of energetic cold that can bounce off walls to hit
targets twice.
%%%%
Regenerate Other spell

Causes another creature to rapidly regenerate over a short period of time.
This regeneration is proportional to that creature's maximum health.
%%%%
Rending Blade spell

Condenses the caster's magical energy into the form of a violently crackling
blade. Each time the caster successfully hits with a melee attack while the
spell is active, this blade will rend a path back and forth through nearby foes,
dealing irresistible damage.

Casting this spell temporarily drains *all* of the caster's remaining magical
power to constitute the blade, but this energy will be returned to them as soon
as the blade ceases to exist. Each point of magical power sequestered this way
slightly increases the damage the blade inflicts.
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than
penetrating attacks.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Rimeblight spell

Afflicts a creature (and up to two others near it) with a magical plague that
slowly freezes them from the inside out. Victims take AC-ignoring cold damage
each turn, and as the disease progresses, shards of crystalline ice will start
erupting violently from their body, damaging nearby enemies. When they finally
succumb, the plague may spread to those around them.

In living, holy, or demonic creatures, the disease is especially virulent,
feeding off the necromantic energies released by its host's suffering. As they
approach the point of death, it will accelerate rapidly, devouring the last
vestiges of their body and leaving nothing behind but a twisted pillar of
stygian ice.
%%%%
Roll spell

Roll into a ball, granting the boulder beetle tremendous speed as well as
double melee damage. The roll may only be performed when at distance from a
foe, and the beetle will always unroll after an attempted roll attack.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Blasts a target with high-velocity rock shards. Gathering the rock from ambient
grit is slow, making this spell take one-and-a-half times as long to cast as
most. Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sap Magic spell

Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while
afflicted with this condition causes the target to lose access to their magic,
briefly preventing them from casting any further spells.
%%%%
Scattershot spell

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Scorch spell

Scorches a random foe. Those injured by this have their resistance to fire
burned away for a short time.
%%%%
Sculpt Simulacrum spell

Forms icy simulacra of an adjacent living, demonic, or holy creature. These
fragile doppelgangers will take shape over a short period of time, eventually
gaining the ability to move and attack the caster's enemies.

The good gods frown on this spell, as it works blood and ichor into unnatural
facsimiles.

You can maintain up to 5 simulacra simultaneously.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous piercing ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. So
long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and supplies it with magical
power (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions), the ray will
follow the caster's target if it should move.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature, leaving a cloud of flames at
the endpoint.
%%%%
Seismic Stomp spell

Stomps heavily upon the ground, sending out violent shockwaves that fracture the
ground beneath multiple nearby enemies. Flying creatures take greatly reduced
damage from this attack, but those on the ground may sometimes to lose their
footing altogether, delaying their next action as they struggle to regain
balance on the uneven terrain.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

Bestows a strong beacon upon a targeted creature. It announces the presence
and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%
Seracfall spell

Violently collapses a nearby simulacrum into a large mass of ice, which
explodes on impact. The ice affects even cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due
to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Shadowball spell

Hurls a ball of flickering shadows, which explodes in a small area.
%%%%
Shadow Beam spell

Fires a penetrating beam of shadow.
%%%%
Shadow Bind spell

Pins several random nearby enemies to their own shadows, briefly preventing them
from moving. At higher spellpower, it affects more enemies at once.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

Creates replicas of creatures native to the caster's current location, weaving
them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.
%%%%
Shadow Draining spell

Forcefully steals a sliver from the shadows of all nearby enemies, causing
damage which bypasses the victim's armour entirely.
%%%%
Shadow Prism spell

Conjures a shadowy prism which will unleash a violent blast of shadows after a
short duration. If destroyed prematurely, this blast will be much weaker.
%%%%
Shadow Puppet spell

Summons a servant of living shadow to harass and constrict the caster's enemies.
The strength of its attacks is directly increased by spellpower.
%%%%
Shadow Shard spell

Fires a shard of hardened shadow at a single enemy.
%%%%
Shadow Shot spell

Fires a small bullet of hardened shadow at a single enemy.
%%%%
Shadow Tempest spell

Calls down shadowy lightning upon up to half of all visible enemies, dealing
irresistible damage to them.
%%%%
Shadow Torpor spell

Saps the energy from a line of enemies, slowing them for a short while.
Spellpower increases the duration of this effect, but stronger creatures may
shake off their lethargy more quickly.
%%%%
Shadow Turret spell

Forms a stationary turret of solidified shadow that repeatedly fires upon the
caster's enemies.
%%%%
Shatter spell

Causes an enormous burst of concussive force around the caster, dealing severe
damage to all nearby creatures. It is especially effective against those made
from ice, bone, or any wall-like substance (such as rock, metal or crystal), as
well as those turned to stone by petrification. It is less effective against
flying, gelatinous and insubstantial creatures. It may also destroy nearby
walls.
%%%%
Sheza's Dance spell

Summons weapons from far and wide - a dagger newly forged, a sword long-rusted
in a moldering tomb, an axe still steaming with the blood of its victim -
animating them and sending them out to attack.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Shred spell

Spins in place, dealing grievous damage to adjacent enemies with its serrated
body.
%%%%
Sigil of Binding spell

Creates two sigils nearby. Anyone who passes over them will be bound, able to
act and dodge normally but unable to move away. When the effect wears off,
their movement speed will rebound, giving them temporary swiftness. Swiftness
from any source grants immunity to binding.

Only one set of sigils can be maintained at a time, and they will expire
prematurely if they leave your sight.
%%%%
Sign of Ruin spell

Inflicts the sign of ruin upon a group of enemies, condemning their bodies to
inexorable decay and collapse. Whenever anything bearing this sign receives
damage from a melee attack, they will suffer heavy draining and may additionally
become either slow, weak, or blind.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Siphon Essence spell

Torments nearby living foes, cutting their health in half. This damage is never
directly lethal. The pain inflicted then heals the user.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Sleep spell

Puts a targeted creature to sleep. Taking damage will typically wake the
target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

Slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Slug Dart spell

Fires a sharp dart of hardened chitin.
%%%%
Smiting spell

Smites any targeted enemy within sight, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Sojourning Bolt spell

Breathes a penetrating and unstable bijection burst. If it hits, it may teleport
victims after a short delay. For particularly interesting morsels of adventurers
such as yourself, this teleport will translocate those victims towards the
caster's allies and bring the caster along for the ride, if possible.
%%%%
Soul Splinter spell

Attempts to force a tiny fragment of a living, holy, or demonic being's soul to
take leave of their body and manifest as a soul wisp. This wisp is nominally
under the necromancer's control, but will focus its attacks foremost on the
creature it was created from, instinctually trying to return to its proper home
once more. The victim will be weakened until the wisp reverts to where it
belongs.

Wisps created from more powerful souls have more damaging attacks, but are
always fragile.
%%%%
Spawn Tentacles spell

Extends large tentacles to attack nearby enemies.
%%%%
Spectral Cloud spell

Creates a cloud of spectral mist, dealing minor damage to all creatures other
than the undead. Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will
coalesce from the mist over time.
%%%%
Spellspark Servitor spell

Constructs a metallic servant with a spark of the caster's own arcane knowledge
at its core. This spark allows the servitor to unleash some of the destructive
spells known to its creator, though the strongest and most volatile
of magics cannot be imbued in this fashion. The strength of the servitor
increases with spell power.

(While you know this spell, you may choose which of your eligible spells it will
cast with the Imbue Servitor ability.)
%%%%
Spit Acid spell

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature. Half of its damage bypasses fire resistance.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%
Splinterfrost Shell spell

Constructs a frangible shell of reinforced ice in a half-circle around the
caster, pushing creatures out of the way to make space for it, if possible.

This barricade is durable, and whenever a segment of it is destroyed, will
fracture into a salvo of icy projectiles launched at whatever destroyed it.

If the caster strays too far away from their barrier, it will melt rapidly.
%%%%
Splinterspray spell

Fires a burst of wooden splinters. Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sporulate spell

Releases a fast, gas-filled floating spore. After seeking out its foe, the
spore will explode, damaging anything caught in the blast and further confusing
living creatures.
%%%%
Sprint spell

Causes the caster to move across terrain more rapidly for a short duration.
%%%%
Starburst spell

Releases penetrating bolts of fire from the caster in every direction.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

Releases electrical charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to
other adjacent creatures, or back to the caster, before eventually grounding
out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the caster, and the damage dealt
bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature.
%%%%
Steam Breath spell

Unleashes a short-ranged spray of incendiary goo that clings to an adjacent

If the target is insubstantial, the liquid fire will fail to stick.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a polar vortex from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration
to maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.

but never directly lethal. The efficiency of the conversion increases with the
spell's power.
%%%%

to succeed. While the spell holds, a spirit of the forest will be called forth,

Summon Seismosaurus Egg spell

Summons the egg of a brutish lizard, just on the verge of hatching. So long as
there are foes nearby and the caster remains adjacent to the egg, it will hatch
several turns after being summoned to wreak havoc upon its summoner's foes.

Even as a juvenile, a seismosaurus is a force to be reckoned with. It is nearly
as hardy as a mountain, and its footfalls are capable of creating violent
seismic shockwaves. Each shockwave deals considerable damage to non-flying
enemies, and may sometimes even cause them to lose their footing altogether.

the ground shortly thereafter.

Certain powerful named artefacts cannot be animated, and any properties that

creations.

Sends the caster hurtling at a chosen nearby enemy, launching a high-accuracy
melee attack on arrival. Additional electric damage will be dealt based on the
length of the charge, the power of the spell, and the physical damage of the
attack. The caster is wrapped in an envelope of twisted space, allowing them
to safely pass through creatures, traps, and harmful terrain, and to displace
creatures at their destination. The time taken by the spell is the greater of
the time normally needed to cast a spell or that needed to launch one melee
attack.
%%%%

those enchantments will be torn apart, transforming into a spray of
destructive mutagenic radiation. The victim and anyone adjacent will be
blasted and heavily deformed, weakening them and reducing their armour.
Summoned creatures are particularly vulnerable, as the enchantments binding
them to this plane will unravel and cause them to be dismissed immediately.
