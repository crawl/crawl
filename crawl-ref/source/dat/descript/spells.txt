creatures may resist the effects). The caster may experience vertigo briefly
as a result of making contact with other minds. It is frequently used as an
icebreaker at wizard parties.

is unstable, so eventually those reanimated will crumble to dust. Zombies and
skeletons cannot leave the level they were created on.

Extremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist

Continuously abjures hostile summoned creatures in the vicinity of the caster.
This reduces their remaining time before being sent back where they came from.
%%%%

cast their magic more powerfully and more often, but at the price of fixing
the caster in place until they no longer have any nearby allies they can

Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently
lessens their resilience to injury, to a degree dependent on (and inversely

undead.

wildly and are usually, but not always, positive.

morale. They have no noticeable effect.

Ozocubu's Armour active.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame spell

<Cleansing Flame ability>
%%%%
Cloud Cone spell

Blasts the area near the caster with destructive clouds. At low power, the most
lethal clouds that can be created are noxious fumes. As power increases, this
gives way to roaring flames, freezing vapours, and poisonous gas. At the
highest tiers of power storm clouds, acidic fog and clouds of negative energy
become available.

direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. Casters are advised to use caution;
the lightning is not mindful of what it may hit.

The magic which keeps ball lightnings cohesive has limited range, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if allowed to drift too far away from their caster before
exploding.

Conjure Flame spell

Creates a blazing column of flame in a targeted empty location.
%%%%
Control Undead spell

Enslaves any undead in the vicinity of the caster.

controlled translocations will cause the subject to become contaminated with

emitting in the process a foul miasmic vapour, which eats away at the life
force of any creature it envelops.
%%%%

Instills a corruption within all visible targets, temporarily mutating their
bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the

Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left more resilient when the effect ends. It has no effect on those who
are already undead.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

Fires a ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles spell

Protects the caster from all kinds of projectile attacks, making them
significantly easier to dodge. It is highly effective against both
single-target and penetrating attacks. Each time a missile is deflected the
spell has a chance of expiring, with a lower chance of expiry at high power.
%%%%
Dig spell

Digs a tunnel through unworked rock.
%%%%
Dimension Anchor spell

Blocks any translocations attempted by the affected target, be they voluntary
or not. This includes even some cross-plane effects, although notably not
Banishment.
%%%%
Discord spell

Drives nearby creatures into an insane frenzy, causing them to mercilessly
attack anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.

Disintegrate spell

Violently rends apart anything in a small volume of space. It can be used to
cause severe damage, or remove a chunk of rock.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

Destabilizes the space in a sphere around the caster for a while, causing
anyone nearby to blink away from the caster. The chance of blinking depends on
the distance from the caster, being nearly certain when directly adjacent. It
causes magical contamination when cast.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

Teleports away any creatures within a short distance of the caster. Any
creature that resists the effect will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a chance of being confused by
the warping of space.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.

they become much more robust, although their evasiveness is reduced.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.
%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon

short duration. The prism is extremely fragile and any damage caused to it may

it engulfs.
%%%%

unscathed by damnation.

dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy
creatures.

gnashing teeth are instantly devoured, reinvigorating the caster in their
reptilian rampage. The caster gains innate armour and increased health, and

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded, and wands cannot
be evoked. The form's number of heads is fixed upon casting the spell, and
increases with power.
%%%%
Iceblast spell

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. It affects even
cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Ice Form spell

Transforms the caster into a frozen ice-creature, light enough to float on
water. The caster gains a freezing melee attack, and becomes incredibly
resistant to cold and resistant to poison, but vulnerable to fire.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded, and wands cannot

Converts all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning poisoned creatures from
within. It also turns clouds of poison and mephitic gases into flame. The

depending on power and causing death scarabs to grow and burst from them upon

Turns a nearby ally invisible.
%%%%

%%%%
Irradiate spell

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures and bypassing any armour
they may have. It heavily deforms its targets, weakening them and reducing
their armour. The caster is not left entirely unaffected; some of the magic
lingers, enough to leave them dangerously contaminated after a few castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of magical energy linked to the caster's own magical
reserves. While the battlesphere cannot take independent action, it will fire
volleys of energy at the caster's enemies in sync with its creator's own
destructive conjurations. With increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer
and deals more damage per volley.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Throws a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The sphere will sometimes
explode on impact, and the chance of it doing so is higher if the sphere has
traveled less distance.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

Liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through.
Any movement through liquefied ground will be slowed, and attempts to attack
in melee may fail.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

Fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an explosion of
deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is
strongly reduced by armour.

Targets made from rock, stone, ice or bone will cause a small or medium-sized
explosion. Metal targets will cause a small but particularly damaging
explosion, and targets made from crystal will cause a large and extremely
damaging explosion.

At high power, this spell is capable of destroying some walls: rock, stone or
metal walls have a chance of being destroyed with at least 5, 6 or 7 bars of
power. Crystal walls are particularly brittle and have a chance of being

%%%%
Major Destruction spell

<Major Destruction ability>
%%%%
Major Healing spell

Heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%

unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short

expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster.
%%%%
Malign Offering spell

Causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

Mesmerise spell

caster's line of sight will end the effect.

reduced by armour.

entire pack of harpies. With high power the individual creatures will also gain
increased strength.
%%%%
Necromutation spell

Transforms the caster into a lich — a powerful skeletal figure. The caster
becomes more resistant to cold and hostile enchantments and completely immune
to poison, rotting, negative energy and torment, and requires no food at all
for the duration of the spell. The caster's necromancy spells are increased in
power, and they gain a draining melee attack. The caster also gains some of the
more dubious benefits of having an undead body, such as a vulnerability to holy
damage and Dispel Undead, and an inability to consume potions.
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

Creates a large cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything nearby for as long as the spell lasts.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and a
nascent orb will deal reduced damage.

Residents of the dungeon are able to maintain the orb until it impacts a
target, but when cast by you the orb will dissipate upon leaving your line of
sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

Envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of thick ice. This will slow
the caster's movement slightly, and provides no special protection against cold.
The spell will not function for casters already wearing heavy armour (any body
armour with an encumbrance rating of 5 or more).
%%%%

It prevents the caster from using potions for a brief duration.

suffers minor damage from the backlash.

requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.

no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time, but a gateway
will close when entered, or after a moderate amount of time.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock.
It takes some time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which they will
be helpless.
%%%%

Petrifies a targeted creature. If successful, the target is slowed down for a
while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, the target will
take less damage upon being hit.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.

Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Snake Pit, the Spider Nest,
the Swamp, the Shoals, the Pits of Slime, the Elven Halls, the Vaults, the
Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the specific branch varies
with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. Even those
resistant to poison will be poisoned by it, and a small portion of its direct
damage bypasses poison resistance.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Poisonous Vapours spell

Turns the air around a targeted creature poisonous. Exceedingly little poison
is created, generally just enough to poison the target before dispersing.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

wands or cast spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.

targets for a short duration, spending an additional small amount of magic for

pool of shallow water for a short duration.
%%%%

<Breathe Dispelling Energy ability>
%%%%

energy, electricity, or acid.
%%%%
Recall spell

Recalls any friendly creatures on the same level to a position adjacent to the
caster, over a short duration.
%%%%
Regeneration spell

Reanimates parts of the caster's wounds. This unnatural act dramatically but
temporarily increases the caster's health regeneration, while also speeding
their metabolism.
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than
penetrating attacks. Each time a missile is repelled the spell has a chance of
expiring, with a lower chance of expiry at high power.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Ring of Flames spell

Surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of searing flame, and keeps other fire
clouds away from the caster. This spell attunes the caster to the forces of
fire, increasing the power of their fire magic and giving protection from fire.
However, it also makes them much more susceptible to cold.
%%%%
Ring of Thunder spell

Surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of highly-damaging thunderclouds.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Consumes a stone to create a short blast of high-velocity rock shards. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sap Magic spell

Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while
afflicted with this condition may cause the target to lose control over their
magic, progressively hindering their chances of success as more spells are
cast.
%%%%
Scattershot spell

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. Though
initially mild, so long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and
supplies it with magical power (by waiting in place and not taking any other
actions), the ray will grow in strength until it becomes a surging bolt able to
tear clean through the ranks of the caster's foes.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature, leaving a cloud of flames at
the endpoint.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%
Shadow Bolt spell

Mimics a penetrating damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a
bolt of shadow.
%%%%

them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.
%%%%
Shadow Shard spell

Mimics a damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a shard of
shadow.
%%%%
Shatter spell

Causes an enormous burst of concussive force around the caster. Flying and
gelatinous creatures can escape the worst effects, and insubstantial creatures
are entirely unaffected, but all others will be gravely injured by the blast.
It may also destroy nearby walls.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Shroud of Golubria spell

Bends space around the caster's body, protecting them from some blows by
redirecting their force to the air nearby. Ranged attacks cannot be diverted in
this way. The shroud is highly unstable, and may fall apart unexpectedly under
stress.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

Creates an icy replica from the corpse of the original being. This magic is
unstable, so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud.
Simulacra cannot leave the level they were created on.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Sleep spell

Puts a targeted creature to sleep. Taking damage will typically wake the
target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

Slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Slug Dart spell

Fires a sharp dart of hardened chitin.
%%%%
Smiting spell

<Smiting ability>
%%%%
Song of Slaying spell

Recites ancient verses of battle. Each non-summoned enemy the caster slays in
combat during this recitation temporarily enhances their melee and ranged
skills. The bonus only lasts for the duration of the song; casting this spell
while already singing will start a new song, not extend an existing one.
%%%%
Spawn Tentacles spell

Extends large tentacles to attack nearby enemies.
%%%%
Spectral Cloud spell

Creates a cloud of spectral mist, dealing minor damage to all creatures other
than the undead. Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will
coalesce from the mist over time.
%%%%
Spectral Weapon spell

Draws out the spirit within a wielded weapon to fight for the caster, with its
strength increasing with power. It only attacks when the caster does, and its
kills count as the caster's own. If the weapon is damaged, part of the injury
will be echoed on the caster's body. Only one spectral weapon can be maintained
at a time, and only while the original weapon remains wielded.

Certain powerful named artefacts cannot be affected, and any abilities that
require evocation skill to trigger will not be active.
%%%%
Spellforged Servitor spell

Summons an extraplanar elemental and binds it to a durable shell forged from
the caster's own magic. The servitor is capable of unleashing some of the
destructive spells known to its creator, though the strongest and most volatile
of magics cannot be imbued in this fashion.
%%%%
Spider Form spell

Transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature. The caster becomes
highly evasive and gains a poisonous bite, but gains vulnerability to poison.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded. The caster also
becomes unable to evoke wands, and casting spells becomes slightly more
difficult.
%%%%
Spit Acid spell

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>

%%%%
Static Discharge spell

Releases electrical charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to
other adjacent creatures, or back to the caster, before eventually grounding
out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the caster, and bypasses any armour
the target may have.
%%%%
Statue Form spell

Transforms the caster into a slow but extremely robust stone statue. The
caster's melee damage, both unarmed and with weapons, is substantially
increased. The caster's stone body is insulated from electricity and gains
resistance to poison, rotting and negative energy.

While transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature.
%%%%
Sticks to Snakes spell

Transforms a number of arrows in inventory into short-lived snakes, creating
more dangerous snakes with higher power.

for a short time.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

Conjures a glob of sticky flame, covering an adjacent creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a tornado from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration to
maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.
%%%%
Sting spell

Fires a magical dart of poison.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

Fires a sharp spine of rock.
%%%%
Strip Resistance spell

Greatly reduces the target's magic resistance, making them more vulnerable to
hostile enchantments.

but never directly lethal. The efficiency of the conversion increases with the
spell's power.
%%%%

%%%%
Summon Butterflies spell

Creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!
%%%%

to serve the caster for a time. The demon's servitude is not guaranteed, but
will be more likely with high power.

to succeed. While the spell holds, a spirit of the forest will be called forth,
and the trees of the forest will be awakened to deal damage to nearby enemies.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

Calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster. With
high power, the summoned demon will be less likely to be initially hostile —
but the strongest demons may eventually turn against their summoner regardless.
%%%%
Summon Guardian Golem spell

Summons a protective golem. It redirects the injuries of its allies (but not
the caster) to itself. When sufficiently damaged, it may fill with an inner

%%%%
Summon Holies spell

of electricity at the caster's foes, but is completely immobile.

significant portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

Creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe spell

Entombs the caster within walls of rock. These walls will push away objects in
their way, but their growth is obstructed by the presence of any creature. They
are not permanent, and will expire after a period of time.
%%%%
Tornado spell

Turns the air around the caster into a mighty vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and
tossed around. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the
caster. The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After
the tornado fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand spell

<Trog's Hand ability>
%%%%

%%%%

brambles are sparse enough that almost any missile can pass through unhindered.
