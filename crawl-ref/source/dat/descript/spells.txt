%%%%
Abjuration spell

This spell attempts to send the targeted hostile summoned creature to the place
whence it came, or at least shorten its stay in the caster's locality.
%%%%
Agony spell

This spell cuts the resilience of a target creature in half, although it will
never cause death directly.
%%%%
Airstrike spell

This spell causes the air around a creature to twist itself into a whirling
vortex of meteorological fury. This spell is especially effective against
flying enemies.
%%%%
Alistair's Intoxication spell

This spell works by converting a small portion of brain matter into alcohol,
confusing all intelligent humanoids within the caster's view (although
poison-resistant creatures will suffer no negative effects). It is strongly
focused on the caster, however, and so poison resistance will not protect them.
It is frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Animate Dead spell

This spell causes the dead to rise up and serve the caster; every corpse within
sight of the caster is affected. By means of this spell, powerful casters could
press into service an army of the mindless undead. Note that zombies are
incapable of leaving the level they were created on.
%%%%
Animate Skeleton spell

This spell raises an inert skeleton to a state of unlife, even if that skeleton
is still encased in flesh! Note that skeletons are incapable of leaving the
level they were created on.
%%%%
Apportation spell

This spell allows the caster to pull the top item or group of similar items
from a distant pile to the floor near the caster. The mass of the target
item(s) will make the task more difficult, with some items too massive to ever
be moved by this spell.

Extremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist
the pull of this spell.
%%%%
Awaken Forest spell

This spell allows the caster to give some very limited motility to
surrounding trees, allowing them to sway their branches and shift their
roots. Such enchanted trees will lash at any enemy foolish enough to stand
close enough.
%%%%
Banishment spell

<Banish ability>
%%%%
Beastly Appendage spell

This spell makes you temporarily replace one or a pair of appendages with an
animal counterpart, giving you an extra attack. It is not powerful enough to
meld armour.
%%%%
Berserker Rage spell

<Berserk ability>
%%%%
Blade Hands spell

This spell causes long, scythe-shaped blades to grow from the caster's hands.
It makes spellcasting somewhat difficult.
%%%%
Blink spell

This spell randomly translocates the caster a short distance.
%%%%
Bolt of Cold spell

This spell hurls a great bolt of ice and frost.
%%%%
Bolt of Draining spell

This spell hurls a deadly bolt of negative energy, which drains the life from
any living creature it strikes.
%%%%
Bolt of Fire spell

This spell hurls a great bolt of flames.
%%%%
Bolt of Inaccuracy spell

This spell inflicts enormous damage upon any creature struck by the bolt of
incandescent energy conjured into existence. Unfortunately, it is very
difficult to aim and very rarely hits anything. Pity, that.
%%%%
Bolt of Magma spell

This spell hurls a sizzling bolt of molten rock, capable of dealing some
physical damage even to highly fire-resistant enemies.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

This spell instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also
permanently lessens his or her resilience to injury — to a degree dependent on
(and inversely related to) magical skill.

The spell is powerful enough to literally pull someone out of Death's Door,
although the shock will render the caster incapable of action for a while.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms spell

<Brothers in Arms ability>
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar spell

This spell summons a canine to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Call Imp spell

This spell calls forth a minor demon from the pits of Hell.
%%%%
Cause Fear spell

This spell causes fear in those near to the caster.
%%%%
Chain Lightning spell

This spell releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs from target to
target until it grounds out. It may ground out harmlessly if there are no
targets sufficiently close to the caster, however.
%%%%
Chaos Breath spell

This creature may exhale a large cloud of fumes filled with the very essence
of chaos. Effects of getting caught in this cloud are about as predictable
as Xom him- or herself.
%%%%
Cold Breath spell

This creature may exhale a focused blast of icy-cold air. It may knock back
airborne targets.
%%%%
Condensation Shield spell

This spell causes a disc of dense vapour to condense out of the air surrounding
the caster. It acts like a normal shield, but its density (and therefore
stopping power) depends upon the caster's skill with Ice Magic. The disc is
controlled by the caster's mind and thus will not conflict with the wielding of
a two-handed weapon.
%%%%
Confuse spell

This spell induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch spell

This spell enchants the caster's dominant hand with magical energy. This energy
is released when the caster touches a monster with their bare hand, and may
induce a state of confusion in the monster.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

This spell allows the conjurer to create ball lightning. Using the spell is not
without risk — ball lightning can be difficult to control.
%%%%
Conjure Flame spell

This spell creates a column of roaring flame.
%%%%
Control Teleport spell

This spell allows the caster to control their next translocation – either by
selecting an approximate target for a teleport, or by selecting a direction for
a blink. Be wary that controlled translocations will cause the subject to
become contaminated with magical energy, and that controlled teleports will
take longer to trigger than uncontrolled ones.
%%%%
Control Undead spell

This spell attempts to enslave any undead in the vicinity of the caster.
%%%%
Controlled Blink spell

This spell allows short-range translocation, with precise control. Be wary that
controlled teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical
energy.
%%%%
Corona spell

This spell causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a
creature. This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and
thereby makes the affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corpse Rot spell

This spell rapidly accelerates the decomposition of any corpses lying around
the caster, emitting in the process a foul miasmic vapour, which eats away at
the life force of any creature it envelops.
%%%%
Cure Poison spell

This spell removes poison from the caster's system.
%%%%
Darkness spell

This spell dims the light of the dungeon, reducing the range of vision. The
area affected is quite large and it doesn't have sharp edges, thus the effect
is unlikely to alert anyone not very close to the caster.
%%%%
Dazzling Spray spell

This spell fires a spread of scintillating energy bolts from the caster's
fingertips which can dazzle the vision of any living creature they strike,
leaving them stumbling about blindly.
%%%%
Death Channel spell

This spell raises living creatures slain by the caster and his or her allies
into a state of unliving slavery as spectral things.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

This spell is extremely powerful, but carries a degree of risk. It renders
living casters nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but can bring them
dangerously close to death. So close in fact, that the body believes itself to
be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. Being
more skilled at Necromancy leaves the caster more resilient. Undead cannot use
this spell.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

A ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles spell

This spell protects the caster from all kinds of projectile attacks, by slowing
them and somewhat diverting their path. Successfully deflecting an incoming
projectile still requires a reflexive action (your ability to do so is measured
by the Evasion stat), but unlike lesser spells like Repel Missiles, Deflect
Missiles typically makes this so easy that even a drunk plate-clad orc can do
it.
%%%%
Delayed Fireball spell

Successfully casting this spell gives the caster the ability to instantaneously
release a fireball at a later time. Knowing this spell allows the learner to
memorise Fireball for no additional spell levels.
%%%%
Demonic Horde spell

This spell calls forth a small swarm of small demons to do battle with the
caster's foes (and sometimes with each other!).
%%%%
Dig spell

This spell digs a tunnel through unworked rock.
%%%%
Discord spell

This spell drives nearby creatures into an insane frenzy, mercilessly
attacking anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.
%%%%
Disintegrate spell

This spell violently rends apart anything in a small volume of space. It can
be used to cause severe damage, or remove a chunk of rock.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

This spell destabilizes the space in a sphere around you for a while, causing
anyone nearby to be randomly blinked. The chance of blinking depends on the
distance from you, being nearly certain when directly adjacent.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

This spell uses the very forces that bind an undead creature together to
inflict a great deal of damage on it.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

This spell tries to teleport away any monsters directly beside the caster.
%%%%
Draconian Breath spell

[This spell should have been replaced by a colour-specific one.  If you got
it, this is a bug.]
%%%%
Dragon Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a great, fire-breathing
dragon. Draconian casters will instead retain their innate colour and breath
weapon once transformed.
%%%%
Drain Life spell

<Drain Life ability>
%%%%
Druid's Call spell

This spell allows a druid to recall a woodland creature or two from a
location on the same dungeon level.
%%%%
Enslavement spell

This spell causes an otherwise hostile creature to fight on your side for a
while.
%%%%
Ensorcelled Hibernation spell

This spell tries to lower its target's metabolic rate, inducing hypothermic
hibernation.
%%%%
Excruciating Wounds spell

This spell temporarily infuses the weapon held by the caster with the essence
of pain itself. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to
special enchantments. Note that unlike other brands, pain can not be made
permanent by reading a scroll of vorpalise weapon.
%%%%
Fire Brand spell

This spell sets a weapon or launcher held by the caster ablaze. It will not
affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Fire Breath spell

<Breathe Fire ability>
%%%%
Fire Storm spell

This spell calls forth a mighty storm of roaring flame directly onto the
target, dealing partially irresistible fire damage in a large area and leaving
behind short-lived fire vortices.
%%%%
Fireball spell

This spell hurls an exploding bolt of fire. This spell does not cost additional
spell levels if the learner already knows Delayed Fireball.
%%%%
Flame Tongue spell

This spell creates a short burst of flame.
%%%%
Flight spell

This spell grants to the caster the ability to fly through the air.
%%%%
Force Lance spell

This spell fires a shaft of concussive force which can send its target hurtling
backwards if the impact is not nullified by their defenses.
%%%%
Freeze spell

This spell freezes a creature. This may temporarily slow the metabolism of a
cold-blooded creature.
%%%%
Freezing Aura spell

This spell surrounds a weapon or launcher held by the caster with an aura of
freezing cold. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to
special enchantments.
%%%%
Freezing Cloud spell

This spell conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%
Fulminant Prism spell

This spell conjures a prism which channels magical energy from its surroundings
and unleashes it after a short while as a violent explosion of arcane force. Be
warned that the prism is extremely fragile and any damage caused to it may
result in premature detonation!
%%%%
Haste spell

This spell speeds the actions of a creature. Hasting yourself will increase
your magical contamination.
%%%%
Haunt spell

This spell calls wraiths and ghosts to haunt the caster's target. Calling on
the undead exacts a toll on the caster's health, however.
%%%%
Hellfire spell

<Hellfire ability>
%%%%
Holy Breath spell

This creature can exhale a large cloud of blessed flame, shining with the
glory of the good gods. These flames are especially dangerous to those
meeting The Shining One's definition of evil.
%%%%
Ice Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster's body into a frozen ice-creature,
light enough to float on water.
%%%%
Ice Storm spell

This spell hurls a raging blizzard of ice, sleet and freezing gasses at the
target, dealing partially irresistible cold damage in a large area.
%%%%
Ice Storm spell:quote

“Neither Deluge Nor Ice Storm Nor The Black Silence Of The Netherhells Shall
Stay These Messengers About Their Sacred Business. Do Not Ask Us About
Sabre-Tooth Tigers, Tar Pits, Big Green Things With Teeth Or The Goddess Czol.”
    -Anghammarad, “Going Postal”, Terry Pratchett.
%%%%
Ignite Poison spell

This spell attempts to convert all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning
poisoned creatures from within. It is very effective against innately poisonous
creatures. The caster is not affected.
%%%%
Infusion spell

This spell infuses the caster's melee attacks with magic, drawing from their
reserves of magical energy to deal additional damage whenever an enemy is hit.
It has no effect when the caster's magic is depleted.
%%%%
Injury Mirror spell

<Injury Mirror ability>
%%%%
Ink Cloud spell

Krakens are known to inject an opaque liquid into water to secure their
escape if a fight goes awry. Unlike their lesser cousins, this ink is potent
enough to obscure vision above water as well, if the kraken stirs the water
enough.
%%%%
Inner Flame spell

This spell fills an enemy with an intense fire, to be explosively released upon
death. The size of the explosion caused is dependent on the size of the target.
%%%%
Invisibility spell

This spell hides a creature from the sight of others. While invisible you will
gain magical contamination, which may eventually cause enough glow to make you
visible again.
%%%%
Iron Shot spell

This spell hurls a large and heavy metal bolt at the caster's foe.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

This spell conjures a small globe of magical energy linked to the caster's own
reserves of power, which will hover alongside its creator and augment their
destructive might. While the battlesphere cannot take independent action, it
will fire volleys of energy at the caster's enemies in near-perfect sync with
its creator's own destructive conjurations.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

This spell throws a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The sphere will
sometimes explode on impact, and the chance of it doing so is higher if the
sphere has traveled less distance.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

This spell liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move
through. Any attempt to move through the liquefied ground will be a very slow
one.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

This spell fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an
explosion of deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or
any wall-like substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification.

Targets made from rock, stone, ice or bone will cause a small or medium-sized
explosion. Metal targets will cause a small but particularly damaging
explosion, and targets made from crystal will cause a large and extremely
damaging explosion.
%%%%
Lehudib's Crystal Spear spell

This spell hurls a lethally sharp bolt of crystal.
%%%%
Lethal Infusion spell

This spell infuses a weapon held by the caster with unholy energies. It will
not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Lightning Bolt spell

This spell hurls a mighty bolt of lightning. Although this spell inflicts less
damage than similar fire and ice spells, it can at once rip through whole rows
of creatures.
%%%%
Magic Dart spell

This spell hurls a small bolt of magical energy. It never misses.
%%%%
Major Healing spell

This spell heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Malign Gateway spell

This spell tears a gash in reality, creating a self-sustained but thankfully
temporary portal to an unknown, tainted otherworld. Which dastardly denizens of
this place might choose to poke their tentacled appendages through, nobody
knows, but certainly nobody would want to be nearby when it happens.
%%%%
Mass Abjuration spell

This spell attempts to send all hostile summoned creatures in sight to the
place whence they came, or at least shorten their stay in the caster's
locality.
%%%%
Mass Confusion spell

This spell causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Melee spell

The rod of striking is designed for melee combat, releasing its charges to deal
additional damage dependent on evocations skill when it strikes a foe. Maces &
Flails skill will help improve your basic effectiveness with the weapon.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

This spell conjures up a large but short-lived cloud of vile fumes.
%%%%
Mesmerise spell

This spell makes its victim unwilling to move away from the caster.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation spell

This spell tries to lower the metabolic rate of every creature in the caster's
vicinity, slowing all those who are not resistant to cold. It bypasses magic
resistance, although tougher monsters will not be slowed for as long as others.
%%%%
Miasma Breath spell

Uh oh, talk about a nasty case of halitosis. This is not your average ogre's
burp, these noxious fumes can rot your flesh off your bones.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

This spell heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Necromutation spell

This spell first transforms the caster into a lich — a powerful skeletal
figure. The caster gains some powers of death, and becomes more resistant to
cold and hostile enchantments and completely immune to poison, rotting, and
negative energy, and requires no food at all for the duration of the spell.

The caster also gains some of the more dubious benefits of having an undead
body, such as a vulnerability to holy weapons and an inability to consume
potions.

Contrary to what one would expect, this spell works on octopodes, although what
foul necromantic tissue serves as an analogue for bones remains a mystery.
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

This breath includes the same substance as that used in a well-known wizard
spell “Mephitic Cloud”. When inhaled by a person or creature not resistant
to poison, it does only minor damage but can cause confusion and a bad
headache.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

This spell causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting
poison on everything nearby for as long as the spell lasts. Be warned that this
magic is baleful for its user, as the epicenter of the aura is potent enough to
afflict even those otherwise resistant to poison.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

This spell conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most
other projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home
onto their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile
opponents may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to
stabilize, and a nascent orb won't do the full damage it is capable of.

It is said that most copies of this spell suffer from a scribal error that
makes the orbs unstable beyond a short range. Certain individuals may have
access to spellbooks without this flaw, so beware!
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

This spell envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of ice, the power
of which depends on his or her skill with ice magic. The caster and the
caster's equipment will not suffer cold from this layer, yet can be affected by
other sources of cold normally. The spell will not function for casters already
wearing heavy armour (any body armour with an encumbrance rating of 6 or more).
The effects of this spell are boosted if the caster is in ice form.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

This spell drains the heat from the caster and his or her surroundings, causing
harm to all creatures not resistant to cold.
%%%%
Pain spell

This spell inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature. The
caster suffers minor damage from the backlash.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

This spell prevents a creature from moving.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

This spell opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow
instantaneous transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering
them. There is no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time,
but a gateway will close when entered or after a moderate amount of time.
%%%%
Passwall spell

This spell tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through
solid rock. This can be dangerous, since it takes time for the caster to attune
to the rock, during which time they will be helpless.
%%%%
Petrify spell

This spell attempts to petrify a monster. If successful, the monster is slowed
down for a while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, a
monster will take less damage upon being hit. It also precludes the use of
wings, which can be quite unhealthy above lava.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Catoblepae can exhale calcifying dust, which turns anyone affected for
longer than a brief moment into a statue.  Access to fresh air may let
you recover — but not if your statue gets broken into pieces by the
catoblepas' claws first.
%%%%
Phase Shift spell

This spell allows the caster to phase in and out of the material plane,
allowing them to occasionally avoid blows entirely.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

This spell hurls a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin.
No living thing is completely immune to its effects, and even the undead will
take damage from the physical component of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Splash spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%
Poison Weapon spell

This spell temporarily coats any weapon or launcher with poison. It will only
work on weapons without an existing enchantment.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

This spell conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gasses.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

This spell randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective
against shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

This spell transforms an unwilling victim into a certain pink quadruped, known
for bad table manners, squealing, and rooting for truffles.  Not even angels
and demons are immune — leading to the world's tastiest and nastiest bacon,
respectively.

If the spell is hastily cast, the transformation is temporary; only a days-long
ritual can make the effect permanent.  In either case, the caster's demise will
turn the victims back into their former shapes.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

This spell teleports a fired or thrown missile directly to its target, greatly
increasing its accuracy (but not damage).
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

Some dragon types can breathe dispelling energy, sometimes called
“quicksilver” because of its appearance. Besides causing damage, it
may remove some enchantments, both beneficial and harmful.
%%%%
Recall spell

This spell is greatly prized by summoners and necromancers, as it allows the
caster to recall any friendly creatures nearby to a position adjacent to the
caster.
%%%%
Regeneration spell

This spell reanimates parts of the caster's wounds. This unholy act
dramatically but temporarily increases the caster's recuperative abilities,
while also increasing the rate of food consumption.
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

This spell reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, by
making them significantly easier to dodge.
%%%%
Ring of Flames spell

This spell surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of searing flame, and keeps
other fire clouds away from the caster. This spell attunes the caster to the
forces of fire, increasing their fire magic and giving protection from fire.
However, it also makes them much more susceptible to the forces of ice.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

This spell creates a short blast of high-velocity particles. It works best when
the caster provides some source (by wielding a stone), but will do what it can
with whatever ambient grit is available.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

This spell fires a continuous ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands.
Though initially mild, so long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and
supplies it with magical power (by waiting in place and not taking any other
actions), the ray will grow in strength until it becomes a surging beam able to
tear clean through the ranks of the caster's foes.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

This spell weaves a creature from shadows and threads of ethereal matter. The
creature thus brought into existence will recreate some type of creature found
in the caster's immediate vicinity. The spell even creates appropriate
equipment for the creature, which are given a lasting substance by their firm
contact with reality.
%%%%
Shatter spell

This spell causes a burst of concussive force around the caster, which will
damage most creatures, although those composed of stone, metal, crystal or
otherwise brittle material will particularly suffer. The magic has been known
to adversely affect walls.
%%%%
Shock spell

This spell throws a bouncing bolt of electricity.
%%%%
Shroud of Golubria spell

This spell bends space along a shroud covering your body, protecting you from
some blows by redirecting their force to the air around you. Ranged attacks
move too quickly to be diverted in this way. The shroud is highly unstable and
may fall apart unexpectedly under stress.
%%%%
Silence spell

This spell eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls,
casting spells, praying or yelling in the caster's vicinity impossible.
(Applies to caster too, of course.) This spell will not hide your presence,
since its oppressive, unnatural effect will almost certainly alert any living
creature that something is very wrong.

Silence starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before the effect times out. Some
creatures, such as demons, cast magic without speaking and so will be
unaffected, and those with innate magical abilities will also still be able to
use them.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

This spell uses a piece of flesh in hand to create a replica of the original
being out of ice. This magic is unstable so eventually the replica will
sublimate into a freezing cloud, if it isn't hacked or melted into a small
puddle of water first. Note that simulacra are incapable of leaving the level
they were created on.
%%%%
Sleep spell

This spell attempts to put its target to sleep. Taking damage will typically
wake the affected person, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

This spell slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Smiting spell

<Smiting ability>
%%%%
Song of Shielding spell

This spell draws from your magical essence to create a temporary protective
barrier. Incoming damage will be absorbed by the shield, decreasing the
caster's available magic in the process.
%%%%
Song of Slaying spell

This spell conjures ancient verses of battle within your mind and makes you
recite them — quite loudly! Each non-summoned enemy you slay in combat during
this recitation temporarily enhances your melee skills. Your effectiveness
will only be enhanced for the duration of the song; casting this spell while
already singing will start a new song, not extend an existing one.
%%%%
Spectral Weapon spell

This spell draws out the spirit within a wielded weapon to fight for you, with
its power dependent on your skill with said weapon. Never striking on its own,
it only attacks when you do. You can only ever have one spectral weapon at a time.

Kills by a spectral weapon count as your own when singing a Song of Slaying.

Certain powerful named artefacts possess too strong a spirit for this spell
to be able to draw them out.
%%%%
Spider Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a swift, venomous (but
poison-susceptible), spider-like creature. Spellcasting is slightly more
difficult in this form. While in this form, you can cling to walls.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

This spell releases electric charges against those next to the caster. These
may arc to adjacent monsters (or even the caster) before they eventually ground
out.
%%%%
Statue Form spell

This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a slow-moving (but extremely
robust) stone statue, capable of dealing monstrous blows with weapons or bare
fists. The caster's stone body is insulated from electricity and gains
resistance to poison, rotting and negative energy.
%%%%
Sticks to Snakes spell

This spell uses wooden items in the caster's grasp as raw material for a
powerful transmutation. Note that magical artefacts will not be affected.
%%%%
Sticky Flame Splash spell

<Breathe Sticky Flame ability>
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

This spell conjures a sticky glob of liquid fire, which will adhere to and burn
any creature it strikes.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell:quote

“Give a man a fire and he's warm for a day, but set fire to him and he's warm
for the rest of his life.”

    -Terry Pratchett, “Jingo”
%%%%
Sting spell

This spell throws a magical dart of poison.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

This spell hurls a sharp spine of rock outward from the caster.
%%%%
Stoneskin spell

This spell hardens one's skin to a degree determined by one's skill in Earth
Magic. It only works on relatively normal flesh, and will aid neither the
undead nor the bodily transformed. However, there is one exception: the effects
of this spell will be boosted for casters in Statue Form.
%%%%
Strip Resistance spell

This spell attempts to greatly reduce its target's magic resistance, making
him or her more vulnerable to hexes and similar spells.
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood spell

This spell converts flesh, blood and other bodily fluids into magical energy.
Casters may focus this spell on their own bodies (which can be dangerous but
never directly lethal) or can wield freshly butchered flesh in order to draw
power into themselves.
%%%%
Summon Butterflies spell

This spell creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!
%%%%
Summon Demon spell

This spell opens a gate to the realm of Pandemonium and draws forth one of its
inhabitants to serve the caster for a time (although the demon's servitude is
by no means guaranteed).
%%%%
Summon Dragon spell

This spell summons and binds a powerful dragon to perform the caster's bidding.
%%%%
Summon Elemental spell

This spell calls forth a spirit from the elemental planes to aid the caster. A
large quantity of the desired element must be available; this is rarely a
problem for earth and air, but may be for fire or water. The elemental will
usually be friendly to casters — especially those skilled in the appropriate
form of elemental magic.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

This spell calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the
caster. Beware, for the spell binding it to service may not outlast that which
binds it to this world!
%%%%
Summon Horrible Things spell

This spell opens a gate to the Abyss and calls through one or more hideous
abominations from that dreadful place. The powers who answer this invocation
require of casters a portion of their intellect in exchange for this service.
%%%%
Summon Hydra spell

This spell summons a many-headed hydra to fight alongside the caster for a
short time.
%%%%
Summon Ice Beast spell

This spell calls forth a beast of ice to serve the caster.
%%%%
Summon Scorpions spell

This spell summons one or more scorpions (some of which may not be bound to the
caster's service).
%%%%
Summon Small Mammal spell

This spell summons a small creature to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Summon Swarm spell

This spell summons forth a pestilential swarm.
%%%%
Summon Ugly Thing spell

This spell summons a mutated otherworldly creature to the caster's aid.
%%%%
Sunray spell

This spell calls forth a beam of intense light, damaging its target. Obviously,
invisibility lets the light pass through, leaving such creatures unharmed.
Vampires and shadows are known to be especially vulnerable to it.

Not being a missile, this spell is not affected by Repel and Deflect effects
— you want to be able to see, don't you?
%%%%
Sure Blade spell

This spell forms a mystical bond between the caster and a wielded short blade,
making the blade much easier to use.
%%%%
Swiftness spell

This spell imbues its caster with the ability to achieve great movement speeds.
But this speed comes at a price: the caster is less stealthy and more likely to
blunder into traps while the spell is in effect.
%%%%
Symbol of Torment spell

This spell calls on the powers of Hell to cause agonising injury to any living
thing in the caster's vicinity. Despite its ominous power, this spell is never
lethal.
%%%%
Teleport Other spell

This spell randomly translocates another creature.
%%%%
Teleport Self spell

This spell teleports the caster to a random location.
%%%%
Throw Flame spell

This spell throws a small bolt of flame.
%%%%
Throw Frost spell

This spell throws a small bolt of frost.
%%%%
Throw Icicle spell

This spell throws forth a shard of ice. It is particularly effective against
those creatures not immune to the effects of freezing. But as most of its
destructive potential comes from strong impact and cutting edges, even
cold-resistant creatures are notably affected.
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

This spell creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe spell

This spell entombs the caster within four walls of rock. These walls will
push away objects in their way, but their growth is obstructed by the
presence of any creature. They are not permanent, and will expire after a
period of time.
%%%%
Tornado spell

This spell turns the air around the caster in a mighty vortex, doing tremendous
damage to everyone caught in it. Those affected will also be swept up into the
air and tossed around. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it
follows the caster.

The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas.

As a side effect, this spell may be used to cross lava, but beware of its short
duration.
%%%%
Trog's Hand spell

<Trog's Hand ability>
%%%%
Tukima's Dance spell

This spell causes a weapon held in the caster's hand to dance into the air and
strike the caster's enemies. It will not function on certain wilful artefacts;
any abilities that require evocation skill won't be used either.
%%%%
Twisted Resurrection spell

This spell causes nearby corpses to begin crawling together, merging into
horrible agglomerations of flesh. More and larger corpses result in more
powerful creations.
%%%%
Vampiric Draining spell

This spell steals the life of a living creature and grants it to the caster.
Life will not be drained in excess of what the caster can capably absorb.

However, attempting to drain an undead or demonic creature will backfire on the
caster.
%%%%
Venom Bolt spell

This spell throws a bolt of poison.
%%%%
Warp Weapon spell

This spell temporarily binds a localized warp field to the invoker's weapon.
Note that unlike other brands, distortion can not be made permanent by reading
a scroll of vorpalise weapon.
