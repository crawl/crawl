%%%%
acid dragon scales

The scales of an acid dragon. Although it does not provide its wearer with as
much protection as the armour made from the scales of some larger dragons, it is
somewhat lighter and less encumbering. It is also remarkably smooth, letting
corrosive slime flow off it like water.
%%%%
amulet of faith

A charm crafted to call the attention of the gods to its wearer. This divine
attention makes it easier to please your god, but your god will also take more
notice of your transgressions. The amulet will drain some of your divine favour
when removed.
%%%%
amulet of guardian spirit

An amulet containing a protective spirit which will cause any damage taken to
be divided between the wearer's reserves of health and magic.
%%%%
amulet of magic regeneration

An amulet that increases the wearer's rate of magic regeneration. In order to

of magic.
%%%%
amulet of nothing

An amulet with no special properties.
%%%%
amulet of reflection

An amulet which improves its wearer's ability to shield against attacks. If
no shield is worn, the force the amulet emits can serve as a weak shield on
its own. Regardless, any ranged attacks the wearer blocks will be reflected
back toward the attacker.
%%%%
amulet of regeneration

An amulet that increases the wearer's rate of health regeneration. In order to
function, it must first attune itself to the wearer's body at full health.
%%%%
amulet of the acrobat

An amulet that allows the user to tumble and roll to evade the blows of their
enemies, but only while moving and waiting. While taking other actions
(including climbing stairs) the amulet conveys no benefits.
%%%%
animal skin

A large piece of thick skin covered in fur, cut from the corpse of an animal
and worn as a primitive garment. It offers rudimentary protection against harm,
but, having never been tanned, it carries a light stench of rotting flesh.
%%%%
arbalest

A large piece of machinery used for firing bolts, braced with steel and cranked
with a windlass. It takes some time to load and fire.
%%%%
azure gem

[[gem]]

As clear and blue as a cloudless sky or a depthless sea, this gem holds its
secrets locked within impenetrable depths.
%%%%
bardiche

A long pole with an enormous, cleaving blade on one end.
%%%%
barding

Armour for the scaly midsections of nagas and armataurs.
%%%%
battleaxe

A large war axe with a formidable double-sided head.
%%%%
beast talisman

A large patch of fur around a shining, gold-glowing eye. Transforms the user
into a monstrous, furry were-beast, limbs pulsing with murderous energy.
Shapeshifting skill increases the killing power provided. While transformed,
any gloves, cloaks, headgear and boots are melded.
%%%%
blade talisman

A jagged cluster of blades, almost impossible to grasp without injury.
{{
    local hands = you.hand() .. "s"
    return "Causes long, needle-thin blades to grow from the " ..
           "user's " .. hands
}}, and smaller fragments of metal to grow inside their body, deforming them
and reducing the effectiveness of body armour. Shapeshifting skill mitigates
and eventually eliminates the latter effect, as well as increasing damage
dealt.

While transformed, equipped weapons, shields, and gloves are melded.
%%%%
book of air

A primer on the elemental magics of Air. The great minotaur hero Vuxhurn, given
a copy of this book while trapped atop the tower of a wizard with a particularly
perverse sense of humor, used its pages to construct a rudimentary glider and
soared to freedom.
%%%%
book of annihilations

A tome of arcane fury, greatly sought after by sorcerers. It allows the gifted
and resourceful to conjure destruction with ease.
%%%%
book of armaments

A book describing various magical arms and armours. It was written in the midst
of a particularly bloody civil war, and the text is made substantially less
helpful by its author's frequent digressions describing the crimes committed by
the other side.
%%%%
book of battle

An astonishingly vain and self-aggrandizing work. The author claims credit for a
wide swathe of weapon-augmenting magics, but seems to have misunderstood or
misrepresented most of them. Only a few of the spells described in the book
actually work.
%%%%
book of beasts

A book of spells focused on the summoning of beasts. Its pages nip at careless
readers' fingers.
%%%%
book of blasting

A book of spells used to set off powerful explosions. This edition's binder
was careful to pad the cover, so that if its reader lacked sufficient caution,
the book, at least, would survive.
%%%%
book of blood

A book of works dedicated to the manipulation of blood, both that of the caster
and of creatures with particularly unusual ichor flowing through their veins.
Some claim it to have been composed by the vampire lord Jory, but it's unclear
why he would deign to share his secrets with others.
%%%%
book of burglary

A book containing spells useful for theft, breaking and entering, and other
miscellaneous larceny.
%%%%
book of callings

An introductory text on the magical summoning of beasts and beings from other

beginners who wish to learn the rudiments of one of the featured magical

%%%%
book of chaos

A book of spells that leave the caster's surroundings in a state of complete
disarray. It's not clear why anyone would write such a thing, but it's here.
%%%%
book of conjurations

A book containing an introduction to the destructive magical arts of
Conjurations.
%%%%
book of contraptions

A book of schematics and spells to construct a variety of elaborate mechanisms.
The obvious safety hazards involved with many of them are relegated to a single
footnote on page 157, but to an enterprising adventurer, that might be
considered an upside.
%%%%
book of cryoformation

An illustrated guide to shaping ice into both practical and artistic forms. An
entire chapter is devoted to tables of mineral impurities and their effect on
colour and melting point.
%%%%
book of dangerous friends

A book describing the creation and use of magical entities best kept at arm's
reach. Or, preferably, even farther.
%%%%
book of death

A manuscript containing dark spells of Necromancy. Each page is filled with
grotesque art depicting scenes of disgusting decay.
%%%%
book of debilitation

A spellbook containing spells known for having a particularly unpleasant
effect on their victims. It's considered something of a faux pas in the
wizarding community to be seen with this book in one's collection.
%%%%
book of decay

A book of necromancy, dictated by the god Kikubaaqudgha to an unfortunate
apostle across the course of a nine-day fugue. The necromancer is said to have
finished the dread work with their own life's blood... but of course this is
just a copy, written in almost entirely normal ink.
%%%%
book of displacement

A book of spells to bring others closer, or sometimes farther, depending on the
user's whim.
%%%%
book of dreams

The somniloquent utterings of a famed mystic, using uniquely bizarre imagery
and cryptic digressions to describe spells drawn from the mystic's visions.
%%%%
book of duality

An eclectic spellbook, mingled with rambling philosophical anecdotes about the
twin nature of every action. Even by the end, it remains unclear whether the
author considered there to be some spiritual purity to spells which incorporate
offense and defense into a single motion, or if they just lived a life extremely
pressed for time.
%%%%
book of fire

A book containing advanced spells in the elemental school of Fire, stolen from
the secret college of the djinn.
%%%%
book of fixed level

A book of magic spells.
%%%%
book of fixed theme

A book of magic spells.
%%%%
book of flames

The standard text used in arcane academies by students of the elemental magic
of Fire. Readers are recommended to wear a pair of insulated gloves.
%%%%
book of frost

A book of magic spells, often used as an introduction to the elemental magics
of Ice. Its pages feel unusually brittle, as if they'd crumble at a touch.
%%%%
book of the fortress

A book of spells that purports to make their caster as resilient as a stone
fortress. Its cover is fashioned from thick, magically-reinforced steel, making
the book unreasonably heavy for no obvious benefit.
%%%%
book of geomancy

A book containing basic spells involving the element of Earth. Readers are
recommended to wear a pair of gardening gloves.
%%%%
book of the grave

A heavy tome whose vellum smells faintly of dirt and decay. Those who touch it
frequently report a palpable sense of unease, as if something unwholesome were
buried between its very pages.
%%%%
book of hexes

A spellbook containing an assortment of powerful Hexes, which sparkles and
shimmers as the pages are flipped.
%%%%
book of ice

A book of advanced magical spells using the element of Ice. Readers are
recommended to wear a pair of warm gloves.

book of iron

An ancient, metal-bound spellbook, covered in dark red blotches. Are they
rust stains, or..?
%%%%
book of lightning

A book that fairly crackles with arcane power.
%%%%
book of maladies

A concise catalogue of afflictions, both magical and mundane, often described
with a disquieting degree of cheerfulness. Most of them operate on timescales
too slow to be useful to an adventurer, but a few sound remarkably efficacious.
%%%%
book of metalworking

A tome of advanced Forgecraft magic. Its pages are regularly inlaid with
technical figures made from elaborate metal filigree, perhaps as an illustration
of the author's own skill with the art described herein.
%%%%
book of minor magic

A spellbook containing a variety of simple but useful magical incantations.
Many prominent spellcasters used this book to begin their arcane studies.
%%%%
book of misfortune

A spellbook dedicated to the art of inflicting creative calamities on one's
foes. Superstitious wizards claim that the book itself actually absorbs ill
fortune and carry it around as a good-luck charm, but the effects of this
seem subtle at best.
%%%%
book of movement

A spellbook that seems to leap open at the slightest touch. Its writing flits
from description of one spell to another, giving enough information to truly
understand only a few of them, though all seem to relate to movement in some
way.
%%%%
book of necromancy

A macabre book containing basic Necromancy spells. Readers are recommended to
wear a pair of gloves they don't mind disposing of afterward.
%%%%
book of party tricks

A book containing a variety of fun spells guaranteed to liven up any wizarding
party, as well as a number of toasts, jokes, and party games.
%%%%
book of power

A book of powerful and destructive magic spells, rumbling and shuddering with
barely-contained energies.
%%%%
book of scorching

A magical book, blasted and scoured by long exposure to the desert sun. Upon
its badly-weathered pages lie the secrets to inflicting the desert's dangers
upon the caster's foes.
%%%%
book of sloth

A lazily written book.
%%%%
book of spatial translocations

A basic spellbook on the magical field of Translocations. Many would-be mages
have seen it disappear just as they needed it most.
%%%%
book of spectacle

A book covered in glittering sequins. An impromptu lightshow bursts from every
page, clearly reserving this book for only the tackiest of wizards.
%%%%
book of spontaneous combustion

A heavy tome whose desiccated pages smell faintly of sulphur. The ink with which
it was written is wildly flammable and care must be taken even opening it, but
the power of the spells described therein is undeniable.
%%%%
book of the spheres

A book containing a well-rounded collection of sphere-related spells. Its
final pages begin to describe a spell titled 'Summon Orb of Zot', but sadly,
the remainder of the book has been completely vaporised.
%%%%
book of storms

A book written by the magician Lan Shi, who was preoccupied with the study and
control of natural phenomena. Most of Shi's works have been lost, but those
still remaining are treasured by wizards lucky (or unscrupulous) enough to get
their hands on a copy.
%%%%
book of the dragon

A magical book of spells which allow some command over dragons and their
aspects.
%%%%
book of the wilderness

A book holding lore ripped from distant and untamed lands, allowing their
denizens to be called forth to serve the reader.
{{
    if you.can_smell() then
        return "It smells distressingly musty."
    end

%%%%
book of the earth

A guide to drawing immense power from the depths of the earth. The original was
written as a collaboration between the hill dwarves and the mountain dwarves, but
its compilation was cut short when a massive wave of earthquakes plunged the hill
dwarves' civilisation into ruin.
%%%%
book of the hunter

A mundane book on hunting. Someone has gone through and covered the book in
corrections and scathing criticisms, crossing out entire sections in favour of
spells that accomplish the same task.
%%%%
book of the moon

A book written by a mad wizard, who had become convinced that the moon far above
was composed, not of shining light, but of rock as solid as that beneath one's feet.
Many of the pages have been mangled beyond recognition, seemingly shredded by a
pair of powerful claws... but what would a troll be doing with a spellbook?
%%%%
book of the senses

A scholarly work, describing the senses used by living creatures to perceive the
world around them. A handful of spells are included to demonstrate the principles
being described.
%%%%
book of transmutation

A meticulous compendium of research notes, filled with formulae for decomposing
and reconstituting all manner of substances. The author appears to have had a
strange obsession with becoming a spider, but even if their ultimate aim eluded
them, many of the spells detailed therein are nonetheless quite practical.
%%%%
book of the tundra

A frost-gripped tome describing icy spells, somewhat abridged. The Vaults are
said to hold the full text, but the guardians of that place guard their
treasures jealously.
%%%%
book of the warp

A book of advanced Translocations spells, written by a particularly
misanthropic mage. After its completion, they were never seen again, which may
or may not have been the point.
%%%%
book of touch

A book describing spells requiring very close proximity to their target. The
author seems to have had a low opinion of their wizardly peers, and spends much
of the text describing the hygiene and social etiquette needed to enter close
proximity to other sentient beings.
%%%%
book of unlife

An unholy book describing a variety of magical methods for the creation and
command of undead servants.
%%%%
book of vapours

A book of magic spells for creating an assortment of clouds, vapours and mists.
It is difficult to read, as the text is frequently interrupted by descriptions
of unusually-shaped clouds the author spotted while writing.
%%%%
book of weapons

A book of spells used by rebels against an ancient and evil empire. The rebels
were crushed, but this book was rediscovered years later, found by paladins of
the crusade that finally destroyed the empire and slew its immortal twin
sovereigns.
%%%%
book of wicked creation

A long-forbidden tome, describing spells for various unholy (or, at least,
underhanded) creations. It would be unwise to bring such a book back to the
surface world - better to read it and discard it in some well-hidden location.
%%%%
book of winter

A book of spells written by the sorceress Ellawe, who sought to use her time
productively while trapped inside by particularly harsh weather for over six
months. A postscript details the bloody vengeance she took after discovering
the weather mage responsible.
%%%%
boomerang

A curved, flat, throwing baton designed to return to its user.
%%%%
box of beasts

A box filled with the bizarre leftovers of a depraved wizard's magical
experimentations. Opening it might set loose a friendly mutant beast: bizarre
creatures, each with their own combination of traits. Increased skill with
Evocations will allow stronger beasts to be released.

There are six known traits:
 * Bat beasts fly and move very quickly, but erratically.
 * Fire beasts resist and breathe fire.
 * Ox beasts resist cold, are armoured with thick fur, and can knock back foes.
 * Shock beasts resist electricity and can transform into living lightning.
 * Sting beasts resist poison and have a reaching poison-tail attack.
 * Weird beasts can see invisible and attack with constricting tentacles.

As far as anyone knows, all beasts have exactly two of these traits.

%%%%
chain mail

A suit of armour made entirely out of tiny metal rings.

cloak

%%%%
club

A heavy piece of wood. While clubs are rather primitive weapons, bashing
someone's skull in with one remains a very popular and effective means of
dispute resolution.
%%%%
codex of conductivity

An exhaustive collection of research notes on the effects of electricity upon
everything from sawdust to snozzcumbers, interspersed with spell formulae and
usable technical schematics. The author's handwriting deteriorates shockingly in
the middle of the chapter on spriggan electrophysiology, leading to much
speculation about both their identity and their sense of self-preservation.
%%%%
compendium of siegecraft

An analytical treatise on siege warfare, written in a clear and readable manner.
A majority of its chapters are concerned with logistics and the maintenance of
supply lines, but several detail spells useful for breaching fortifications
(and also other, softer, things).
%%%%
condenser vane

A magical device that condenses ambient energy into various destructive clouds.
When evoked these clouds form around hostile monsters near the user. The
quantity and lethality of these clouds increases with Evocations skill. At low
power it will create noxious fumes, and as power increases this gives way to
roaring flames, freezing vapours, and poisonous gas. At the highest tiers of
power storm clouds, acidic fog and clouds of excruciating misery become
available.
%%%%
corpse

A corpse. Useless and dead.
%%%%
crystal plate armour

An incredibly heavy but extremely effective suit of crystalline armour.

A rotten eggplant which you can throw at the Crawl developers. It's a bug if

eudemon blade

A sacred blade from the forges of Heaven, inhabited by a good spirit. It is a

fire dragon scales

The scales of a fire-breathing dragon. It provides great protection from fire,
while rendering its wearer more susceptible to cold.
%%%%
flail

A mace with a short chain connecting the head to the haft.
%%%%
flux talisman

A canister holding an ominously glowing substance. Its user becomes unstable at
a fundamental level, inflicting dangerous levels of magical contamination on
foes with each touch. Sufficient contamination causes a highly localised meltdown,
dealing enormous damage which increases with the user's Shapeshifting skill.

However, this instability makes the user unable to use weapons, shields or body
armour. They also glow, reducing stealth and preventing invisibility, and their
melee damage is reduced, as their limbs sometimes destabilise mid-swing.
%%%%
gell's gravitambourine

A copper and tungsten tambourine that vibrates excitedly in your hands, as if
eager to be used.

Just as music brings people together, shaking it with the proper rhythm will
draw a large group of monsters into a narrow space and hold any hostile ones in
place for a short time with inescapable waves of crushing gravity.

The area of effect and duration increases with Evocations skill.
%%%%
gem

A stone of unearthly beauty and almost immeasurable value outside the dungeon.
Within its confines, it is utterly useless.

Zot hoards these gems jealously, and will spitefully smash them soon after an
adventurer enters the branch of the Dungeon in which they rest. Still, a very
quick-moving adventurer might seize one first and keep its precious shards.
Zot cannot track gems outside their home branches, so with truly astonishing
speed, it might be possible to abscond with one still intact... but such a
feat is difficult to credit, and likely pointless besides.

Once the Orb of Zot is taken, Zot will be unable to smash any gems.

%%%%
giant spiked club

A giant lump of wood with sharp spikes at one end.

A heavy stone icon, bearing the countenance of some long-forgotten king or god.
Transforms the user into a slow, stone statue. The user's stone body is

energy, and torment. Shapeshifting skill increases armour granted.

While transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.
%%%%
grand grimoire

%%%%
lightning rod

A rod that allows its wielder to fire unavoidable blasts of lightning.
Consecutive evocations cause the discharge to be sustained, which increases the

Transforms the user's midsection into a giant mouth, gnashing and ready to devour

by the user's Shapeshifting skill and the power of the creature eaten. Skill also
increases the damage done by the maw.

While transformed, any body armour is melded.
%%%%
midnight gem

[[gem]]

The stoneborn brought forth this gem from the uttermost depths of the earth as
a gift and a warning: beware Zot! That it lies now within Zot's power is a sure
proof of the perversity of mortals and fate alike.
%%%%
milky-white gem

lived too long in the dark, this gem buzzes with a fearful potential. Still, to
a certain eye, it possesses a strange allure...
%%%%
morningstar

A mace with a head covered in short spikes.

mossy gem

[[gem]]

Though it drips with mud and muck, still a peculiar dignity attaches itself to
this gem. The people of the Swamp, who first carried this stone, struggled
against insurmountable odds. They failed, but there is much to admire even in
the ruin of their efforts.
%%%%
my sojourn through swampland

While purporting itself to be the personal account of a famous naturalist, it
becomes clear upon reading that this book was compiled from multiple unrelated

bats - either to flee or to assail their enemies.
%%%%
sanguine gem

floor is fully mapped, and everything within a moderate radius, including

casting spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the
reader's vicinity. The scroll's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly

usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a large radius, which will then shrink, eventually

thrown to cause minor damage.

%%%%
tin of tremorstones

A set of dormant, magnetic earth elementals in the form of tiny, very heavy
pebbles. When released, the elementals are drawn magnetically to the center of
nearby monsters, where they literally explode with rage at their rest being
disturbed. Tremorstones usually land slightly off-target, and the user is
always at risk of being hit. However, armour is extremely effective at
repelling the lightweight fragments of rock from a tremorstone's explosion, so
a well-armoured wielder has little to fear. Evocations skill increases the
number of explosions.
