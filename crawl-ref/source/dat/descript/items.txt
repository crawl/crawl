to work no differently from the variants found in less-perforated texts.
%%%%

A record of the somniloquent utterings of an entranced mystic, describing a

book remains popular for its uniquely bizarre imagery and cryptic digressions.

as sceptics point out, pretty much everybody who enters the dungeon meets a bad
end.

Many prominent spellcasters used this book to begin their arcane studies.

translocations will contaminate the subject with residual magical energy, and

scroll of acquirement

increases the rate at which it regenerates power.

%%%%
scroll of silence

This scroll eliminates all sound near the reader. This makes actions such as
reading scrolls, casting spells or shouting impossible in the reader's
vicinity. The oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper any attempt to
be stealthy.

Silence starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the reader, before the effect times out. Some
creatures, such as demons, cast magic without speaking and so will be
unaffected, and those with innate magical abilities will also still be able to
use them.

those beings found within the reader's immediate vicinity.
