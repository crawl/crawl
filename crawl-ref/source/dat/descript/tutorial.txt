%%%%
tutorial death

You die...

In Crawl, death is a sad but common occurrence. Note that there's usually
something you could have done to survive, for example by using some kind of
item, running away, resting between fights, or by avoiding combat entirely.
Keep trying, eventually you'll prevail!

# Tutorial map 2: Monsters and combat        #
##############################################
tutorial2 start

This lesson will teach you about monsters and fighting. First, we need a
weapon! Go and grab the one lying over there.
%%%%
tutorial2 pickup_weapon

Pick up this weapon<localtiles> by clicking on it in the inventory panel, and
then wield it by clicking on it again. Alternatively, pick it up</localtiles>
with <input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input> or <input>g</input> and then wield it with
<input>$cmd[CMD_EQUIP]</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 melee

To attack a monster with your bare hands or wielded weapon, simply walk into
it.
%%%%
tutorial2 resting

Very good! You can heal by resting with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>
<localtiles>, or by clicking the 'rest' button in the command bar below the
minimap</localtiles>. This will make you rest until your health is full, but
will be interrupted by important events.
%%%%
tutorial2 wait

Rather than storm the room and get swarmed by monsters, you can also step back
and wait (with <input>$cmd[CMD_WAIT]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on your character</localtiles>) for them to come to you.
%%%%
tutorial2 resting_reminder

Remember, you can rest up with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 compare_monster_desc

# The keyboard commands are skipped in localtiles for clarity.
Examine these monsters (<localtiles>via <input>mouseover</input></localtiles>
<nomouse>by pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</input> to enter examine mode,
and then <input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_CYCLE_FORWARD]</input> to cycle through nearby
monsters</nomouse>)
and compare their descriptions (<localtiles>with <input>rightmouseclick</input></localtiles>
<nomouse>by pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</input> while selecting
them in examine mode</nomouse>)
to find out which of these cages is safer to fight through.
%%%%
tutorial2 downstairs

Well done! After resting to full health continue to the next level with
<input>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</input><localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input>
on your character</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial2 newlevel

Remember: You can reread old messages with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REPLAY_MESSAGES]</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 boomerangs

Now, for ranged combat! Pick up these boomerangs with
<input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input> or <input>g</input><localtiles>, or by
<input>mouseclick</input>,</localtiles> and continue.
%%%%
tutorial2 throwing

You can fire your boomerangs at a monster with <input>$cmd[CMD_FIRE]</input>
<localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input> on them in the inventory
panel</localtiles>. To confirm the auto-targeted monster, press
<input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_SELECT]</input> or <input>Enter</input>. You can skip
this and fire at the closest monster with <input>shift-tab</input> or <input>p</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 wield_bow

Pick up this shortbow and wield it with <input>$cmd[CMD_EQUIP]</input>
<localtiles> or by <input>mouseclick</input></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial2 firing

# FIXME: Lengthy because of the hint for choosing target.
Firing arrows from your wielded shortbow works a bit differently from throwing boomerangs.
Use <input>$cmd[CMD_PRIMARY_ATTACK]</input><localtiles> or <input>mouseclick</input>
</localtiles>. You can change the targeted monster by pressing
<input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_CYCLE_FORWARD]</input> while in target mode. The worm is
harmless behind the lava, so concentrate on the dummy which can fire at you.
Again, confirm your choice with <input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_SELECT]</input> or
<input>Enter</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 travel_reminder

Remember that you can autoexplore using <input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input>.

# Tutorial map 3: Items and Inventory #
#######################################
tutorial3 start

In this lesson you're going to learn about items and how to use them.
%%%%
tutorial3 armour

Pick up these boots with <input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input> and wear them with
<input>$cmd[CMD_EQUIP]</input>.<localtiles> Or simply <input>mouseclick</input>
on them in the inventory panel.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial3 autopickup

Some types of items<tiles>, marked with a green frame,</tiles> are picked up
automatically as you step on them.
%%%%
tutorial3 scroll

Many items are unidentified when you find them. One way to find out what they
do is to use them. Try reading this scroll with <input>$cmd[CMD_READ]</input>
<localtiles> or with <input>mouseclick</input> in the inventory
panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 scroll_noautopickup

Autopickup does not work if there's a monster around. You can either pick up
this scroll now with <input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input><localtiles> or
<input>clicking</input> on your character,</localtiles> or you can fight the
nearby enemy and pick it up afterwards.
%%%%
tutorial3 ego_weapon

An item described as <lightblue>runed</lightblue> or
<lightblue>glowing</lightblue> will always be enchanted, or have special
properties, or both. Once you step on top of such an item, its properties will
be revealed to you.
%%%%
tutorial3 inventory

# TODO: Should give tutorial messages inside the inventory to find the weapon.
#       Maybe there should also be a separate lesson to highlight the commands
#       in the item description screen.
To view the description of your new weapon, find and select it in your
inventory (<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</input>). <localtiles>You can
also <input>mouseover</input> or <input>right click</input> it in the inventory
panel. </localtiles>Notice that all the item commands also work from the item
description screens.
%%%%
tutorial3 battle

Once you've successfully managed to poison a monster, it is sometimes best to
retreat and let the poison do the work. Don't forget to retreat to heal too, if
necessary.
%%%%
tutorial3 downstairs

Well fought! If necessary, rest up with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>, then
continue downwards with <input>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</input><localtiles> or
with a <input>click</input> on your character</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 command_help

If the many commands are too confusing, you can also look them up in the
command help <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]</input>. <localtiles>A number of
commands are also available in the clickable <w>command panel</w> to the right
of the screen. </localtiles>Rereading old messages with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REPLAY_MESSAGES]</input> is available as usual.
%%%%
tutorial3 trap

Traps can have a variety of unpleasant effects, such as alerting monsters or
teleporting you into danger. Some traps are permanent and will always be
revealed as part of the map, but other traps can be triggered by exploring new
tiles, and won't exist after being triggered. If there's no way around, you'll
have to trigger the trap and deal with the consequences.
%%%%
tutorial3 potion

Potions may provide vital healing or useful enchantments, but some have less
desirable effects. You can quaff this potion with
<input>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</input><localtiles> or with
<input>mouseclick</input></localtiles> to discover what it does.
%%%%
tutorial3 artefact_armour

# TODO: Replace unrandart with a real randart. Needs some safeguarding against
#       things that would throw the tutorial off rails (fragile, Contam...)
Items with <w>unusual names</w> are artefacts. Artefacts can have a number of
special properties. Some unique artefacts (such as this cloak) are always
identified and may have special properties that cannot be found anywhere else!
Others are generated with a random selection of properties, and are
unidentified until you step on top of them. Try equipping this cloak with
<input>$cmd[CMD_EQUIP]</input><localtiles> or <input>mouseclick</input>
in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 wand_fire

# TODO: The wand targeting screen could perhaps use a little context help.
You can evoke a wand with <input>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</input><localtiles> or with
<input>mouseclick</input> in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 wand_digging

A wand of digging can destroy rock walls. Use
<input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]][$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</input> <localtiles>or
<input>mouseover</input>/<input>right click</input> </localtiles>to check wall
types.
%%%%
tutorial3 amulet

Jewellery is put on with <input>$cmd[CMD_EQUIP]</input><localtiles>
or with <input>mouseclick</input> in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 drop

This amulet would be very powerful if your character had a god to worship,
but here and now, it's useless. You may want to drop it with
<input>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>Shift-leftclicking</input> it in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 gold

Gold can be spent in shops. It takes no inventory space and cannot be dropped.
%%%%
tutorial3 shop

Shops offer a variety of items, but they don't buy items from anyone.
%%%%
tutorial3 enter_shop

# TODO: Everything else except how to enter the shop should be told in the
#       shopping screen.
To enter this shop, press <input>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</input><localtiles> or
<input>click</input> on your character</localtiles>. To buy items,
select them with their hotkey, hit <input>Enter</input> and confirm with
<input>y</input>es. You can switch to description mode with <input>!</input>.
%%%%
tutorial3 autoexplore_reminder

Remember, you can explore the level automatically with
<input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input><localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input> the
autoexplore command button in the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 go_shopping

# TODO: Should only instruct to start the search here, and put the rest of the
#       instructions into the search screen. Also, it would be good to highlight
#       the search button in the command panel somehow when this message is
#       viewed.
You now have enough gold to do some serious shopping! The quickest way back to
the shop is by searching for it. Type <input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input>,
and then enter “<w>shop</w>”. Select the result to start travelling.<localtiles>
You can also <input>click</input> on the search button in the command panel, or
use the minimap to return to the shop.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial3 optional_battle

Warning, this way leads to <lightred>a difficult battle</lightred>. You may
choose to use what you've learned so far in a fight, or try to reach the other
exit on the island. Either way, it may be a good idea to do some shopping, if
you haven't already.

# Tutorial map 4: Magic and Spellcasting     #
##############################################
tutorial4 start

In this lesson you're going to learn how to memorise and cast spells.
%%%%
tutorial4 spellbook

You can memorise a spell from your spell library with
<input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on the memorisation tab and selecting the spell
tile</localtiles>. At experience level 1, only level 1 spells are available to
you. This will change as you gain experience. To find new spells, find and pick
up spellbooks, and the spells will be added to your library.
%%%%
tutorial4 spellcasting

##       Tiles memorisation: clicking on a spellbook in the inventory might be
##       easier to grasp; could leave the memorisation tab to be discovered by
##       the player on their own.
To cast a spell, first memorise it with <input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input>.
You can then cast it with <input>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on the spell tile</localtiles>.

Press <input>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]</input>, then press <input>?</input> to get a
list of your spells.
%%%%
tutorial4 spellquivering
Spells, like ammo, are shown in the quiver slot, so you can use
<input>$cmd[CMD_QUIVER_ITEM]</input> to ready a spell in the quiver. Use
<input>$cmd[CMD_FIRE]</input> or <input>shift-tab</input> to fire the currently
quivered spell.

Once you are out of magic points, retreat and rest to regain them with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input> the
rest icon in the command panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial4 ring_power

Put on this ring with <input>$cmd[CMD_EQUIP]</input><localtiles> or
by <input>clicking</input> it in the inventory panel</localtiles>, and then
rest up to your new full potential.
%%%%
tutorial4 undead

# TODO: This is more like hints mode stuff. Not sure if there's any harm though,
#       and the mouse interface hint is good.
Unlike most monsters, zombies and skeletons do not regenerate health.
<localtiles> You can also attempt to re-cast the last spell you used by
pressing <input>Ctrl+leftclick</input> on the monster.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial4 spell_success

To check your spell proficiency, press <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</input>
<localtiles> or <input>mouseover</input> over your memorised
spells</localtiles>. Compare your spell failure rates before and after wearing
this ring.
%%%%
tutorial4 mephitic_cloud

Mephitic Cloud is a level 3 spell, so you can't memorise it yet. To level up
quickly, here are more training dummies — without stones to throw this time.

At experience level 3, you'll be able to increase one of your stats — choosing
<input>I</input>ntelligence will help your spellcasting even further.
%%%%
tutorial4 meph_reminder

Don't forget to memorise your newly-available spell, by pressing
<input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on the memorisation tab and selecting the spell
tile</localtiles>!
%%%%
tutorial4 aiming_clouds

Mephitic Cloud covers an area in noxious fumes when cast, and you'll be able to
see the area it affects as you target it. Try to catch multiple enemies in a
single cloud in order to be more efficient with your magic.
%%%%
tutorial4 forget_spell

Gaining experience levels and raising your Spellcasting skill gives you spell
slots to spend on spells. You can also <w>forget a memorised spell</w> to make
space for a new one by reading a scroll of amnesia. Read the scroll (with
<input>$cmd[CMD_READ]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on it</localtiles>), and then select the spell you want
to forget. You can relearn forgotten spells from your spell library later, as
long as you have spell slots available.
%%%%
tutorial4 memorise2

After forgetting one of your old spells to make space, memorise this new spell
with <input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on the memorisation tab and selecting the spell
tile</localtiles>. Then try your new spell and summon some demonic allies!
%%%%
tutorial4 displace_allies

Did you notice you can swap positions with your allies by moving into them?
Among other things, displacing a friendly creature can be a good way to escape
a fight.
%%%%
tutorial4 order_allies

Try to let your allies do the killing! If necessary, you can order them about
with <input>$cmd[CMD_SHOUT]</input>. Before opening this gate, you may want to
wait with <input>$cmd[CMD_WAIT]</input> until your allies have caught
up with you. Your summons will only stick around for a short time, so don't
wait too long, or summon some new ones before starting a fight.
%%%%
tutorial4 heavy_armour

# TODO: Split taking off into separate item.
Heavy armour really hampers spellcasting. Try putting on that mail and shield
(with <input>$cmd[CMD_EQUIP]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on them</localtiles>), and compare your spellcasting
failure rates with <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>mouseovering</input> your memorised spells</localtiles>. You can take
armour off again with <input>$cmd[CMD_UNEQUIP]</input><localtiles> or,
again, via <input>mouseclick</input></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial4 resting_reminder

Make sure you are at full health and magic points before entering a new area.
If necessary, rest up with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>mouseclick</input> in the command panel</localtiles>.

You can only summon a limited number of allies at once from any given spell,
so try to take advantage of a wide range of spells. For example, your summoned
imps are resistant to poison, so you can cast Mephitic Cloud to fight alongside
them without harming your allies.

tutorial5 start

In this lesson you're going to learn about gods and how to use their powers.
%%%%
tutorial5 dungeon_overview

Up ahead is an altar to Trog the Wrathful! Trog is just one of many gods. In a
real game, you can check <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_OVERMAP]</input><localtiles>
or <input>click the dungeon overmap button</input> in the command
panel</localtiles> for a list of all altars and other interesting features
found so far.
%%%%
tutorial5 altar

You can pray on an altar with <input>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</input>
<localtiles> (or by <input>left clicking</input> on your character)</localtiles>
to get an idea what a god offers you, and to join the faith. If
you press <input>!</input><localtiles> or
<input>rightclick</input></localtiles> on the religion screen, you can see a
more detailed description.

Confirm your choice with <input>J</input> or <input>Enter</input>.
%%%%
tutorial5 religion

Have a look at your current religious standing with
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</input><localtiles> (or via the <w>religion
button</w> in the command panel, or by <input>Shift-rightclicking</input> on
the player tile)</localtiles>. Again, pressing <input>!</input><localtiles> or
<input>rightclicking</input></localtiles> will bring up a more detailed
description of your god.
%%%%
tutorial5 piety_on_kill

Some gods really like it if you kill monsters in their name. Let the slaughter
begin!
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk

Against particularly tough foes, you may want to use Trog's Berserk power with
<input>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</input><localtiles> or via the <w>command
panel</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 exhaustion

A berserker rage is truly exhausting. After it ends, you cannot berserk again
for a short while and are slowed. It's best to rest with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles> (or via the
<w>command panel</w>)</localtiles> until you feel fit again.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk2

Berserk is also really useful against multiple enemies — as long as you don't
run out of steam in-between.

tutorial5 tutorial_end

Congratulations! You've finished the last tutorial lesson and are now ready for
the real game. Good luck!
