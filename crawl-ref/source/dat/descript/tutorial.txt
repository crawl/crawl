# Tutorial map 1: Movement and exploration   #
##############################################
tutorial1 start

In this lesson you're going to learn how to move around and explore a level. You can move <localtiles>by clicking somewhere with your <w>[Mouse]</w>, or </localtiles>with the <w>[arrow keys]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 go_on

You're doing great! Now, explore a bit until you reach the next blue square.
%%%%
tutorial1 diagonal

You can move diagonally by way of the <w>[number pad]</w> (try Numlock on/off) or by using the <w>[vi keys]</w>.

<w></w>  Numpad:       <w>7 8 9</w>           vi-keys:    <w>$cmd[CMD_MOVE_UP_LEFT] $cmd[CMD_MOVE_UP] $cmd[CMD_MOVE_UP_RIGHT]</w>

<localtiles>You can also move using <w>[Mouse clicks]</w>.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial1 shiftmove

A quicker way to 'run' through a corridor is to press <w>[Shift]</w> along with the <w>[number pad]</w> (try Numlock on/off) or <w>[vi keys]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 downstairs

When standing on a staircase leading downwards, you can enter the next level with <w>[$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]]</w><localtiles> or with <w>[Shift-Click]</w> on your character</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial1 levelmap

# Messy, repeating the same things for <console> and <webtiles>
What's this? To find out where you are, <tiles>have a look at the <w>minimap</w> to the right of the screen.</tiles><localtiles> You can have a closer look at a part of the map with a <w>[right mouseclick]</w> and also can travel there with a <w>[leftclick]</w>.</localtiles><webtiles>You can enter the overmap view with <w>[$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]]</w> and then move the cursor around to look around the level.

%%%%
tutorial1 autoexplore

Exploring manually can get tedious after a while, so you might want to let that happen automatically. Try it by pressing <w>[$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 exclusion

Some dangerous ground is marked with <w>exclusions</w>. Autoexplore <localtiles>(including by <w>[mouseclick]</w>! </localtiles>will not lead you into exclusions. Instead you will automatically stop.

However, autoexplore will move you safely around exclusions so you may continue by pressing <w>[$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 autoexplore_announce

Autoexplore will stop to announce features and items. To travel directly to the stairs, you can <localtiles><w>[click]</w> on them or you can </localtiles>press <w>[$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP] << Enter]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 tutorial_end

Congratulations! You've completed the first lesson!

To exit the tutorial, simply go up these stairs with <w>[$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[Shift-clicking]</w> on your character</localtiles>. Confirm the resulting prompt with an uppercase <w>[Y]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 newlevel

A new level! To begin with, head over to that door to the right.

Also, remember: You can reread old messages with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REPLAY_MESSAGES]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 door

You can open a closed door by walking into it. To close an open door, press <w>[$cmd[CMD_CLOSE_DOOR]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 secret_door_glass

It doesn't look like the corridor ends here. Try searching for a secret door with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REST]]</w>. This process might spend multiple turns.
%%%%
tutorial1 water

Note how you can move through shallow but not through deep water.
%%%%
tutorial1 secret_door_wall

A dead-end! Or, wait... is it another secret door? Try searching again with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REST]]</w> once again.
%%%%
tutorial1 upstairs

When standing on a staircase leading upwards, you can enter the previous level with <w>[$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[Shift-clicking]</w> on your character</localtiles>.

# Tutorial map 2: Monsters and combat        #
##############################################
tutorial2 start

This lesson will teach you about monsters and fighting. First, we need a weapon! Go and grab the one lying over there.
%%%%
tutorial2 pickup_weapon

Pick up this weapon with <w>[$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]]</w> or <w>[g]</w> and then wield it with <w>[$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]]</w>.<localtiles> Alternatively, you can perform either action by <w>[clicking]</w> on it in the inventory panel.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial2 melee

To attack a monster with your bare hands or wielded weapon, simply walk into it.
%%%%
tutorial2 resting

Very good! You can regain any lost hit points by resting with <w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w>. This will make you rest and search for up to 100 turns, but will get interrupted by a number of important events.
%%%%
tutorial2 chop_corpses

You can chop up corpses into edible meat chunks with <w>[$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]]</w> <localtiles>or <w>[Shift + mouseclick]</w>, </localtiles>and then eat the resulting chunks with <w>[$cmd[CMD_EAT]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[mouseclick]</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial2 rest_and_chop_reminder

# FIXME: Awkward. No mouse commands.
Don't forget about chopping corpses for food (with <w>[$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]]</w>), or resting (with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REST]]</w>)!
%%%%
tutorial2 wait

Rather than storm the room and get swarmed by monsters, you can also step back and wait (with <w>[$cmd[CMD_MOVE_NOWHERE]]</w>) for them to come to you.
%%%%
tutorial2 resting_reminder

Remember, you can rest up with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REST]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial2 eat_reminder

Remember, you can chop creatures up with <w>[$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]]</w> <localtiles>or <w>[Shift + mouseclick], </w>and then eat the resulting chunks with <w>[$cmd[CMD_EAT]]</w><localtiles> or <w>[mouseclick]</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial2 compare_monster_desc

# FIXME: Content repeated for <console> and <webtiles>.
Examine these monsters (<localtiles>via <w>mouseover</w></localtiles><console>with <w>[$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]$cmd[CMD_TARGET_CYCLE_FORWARD]]</w></console><webtiles>with <w>[$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]$cmd[CMD_TARGET_CYCLE_FORWARD]]</w></webtiles>) and compare their descriptions (<localtiles><w>[right mouseclick]</w></localtiles><console><w>[$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]]</w></console><webtiles><w>[$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]]</w></webtiles>) to find out which of these cages is safer to fight through.
%%%%
tutorial2 downstairs

Well done! After resting to full health continue "into the next level with <w>[$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial2 newlevel

Remember: You can reread old messages with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REPLAY_MESSAGES]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial2 darts

Now, for ranged combat! Pick up these darts with <w>[$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[mouseclick]</w>,</localtiles> and continue.
%%%%
tutorial2 throwing

You can fire your darts at a monster with <w>[$cmd[CMD_FIRE]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[clicking]</w> on them in the inventory panel</localtiles>. To confirm the auto-targeted monster, press <w>[$cmd[CMD_TARGET_SELECT]]</w> or <w>[Enter]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial2 wield_bow

Pick up this bow and wield it with <w>[$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[mouseclick]</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial2 firing

# FIXME: Lenghty because of the hint for choosing target.
Firing arrows from your wielded bow works exactly the same as throwing darts: via <w>[$cmd[CMD_FIRE]]</w><localtiles> or <w>[mouseclick]</w>. You can change the targeted monster by pressing <w>[$cmd[CMD_TARGET_CYCLE_FORWARD]]</w> while in target mode. The worm is harmless behind the lava, so concentrate on the dummy which can fire at you. Again, confirm your choice with <w>[$cmd[CMD_TARGET_SELECT]]</w> or <w>[Enter]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial2 travel_reminder

Remember that you can autoexplore using <w>[$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]]</w>.

# Tutorial map 5: Gods and divine abilities  #
##############################################
tutorial5 start

In this lesson you're going to learn about gods and how to use their powers.
%%%%
tutorial5 secret_door

There's got to be an entrance to the temple! Try walking around the glass
walls and searching for secret doors with <w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w><localtiles>
or by <w>mouseclick</w> in the command panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 dungeon_overview

Trog is just one of many gods. In a real game, you check
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_OVERMAP]</w><localtiles> or click on the <w>dungeon overmap
button</w> in the command panel</localtiles>
for a list of all altars and other interesting features found so far.
%%%%
tutorial5 altar

You can pray on an altar with <w>$cmd[CMD_PRAY]</w><localtiles> (or by clicking in
the <w>command panel</w> or <w>Shift-clicking</w> on your
character)</localtiles>
to get an idea what a god offers you, and to join the faith.
If you press <w>!</w>
<localtiles>or <w>rightclick</w></localtiles>
on the religion screen, you can see a more detailed description.

Confirm your choice with an uppercase <w>Y</w>.
%%%%
tutorial5 religion

Have a look at your current religious standing with
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</w><localtiles>
(or via the <w>religion button</w> in the command panel,
or by <w>Shift-rightclicking</w> on the player tile)</localtiles>.
Again, pressing <w>!</w><localtiles> or <w>rightclicking</w></localtiles>
will bring up a more detailed description of your god.
%%%%
tutorial5 piety_on_kill

Some gods really like it if you kill monsters in
their name. Let the slaughter begin!
%%%%
tutorial5 sacrificing

Praying on corpses with <w>$cmd[CMD_PRAY]</w><localtiles> or
via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>
will sacrifice them to Trog. Try it!
%%%%
tutorial5 burn_book

Trog will like it if you burn that book (with
<w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w><localtiles>
or via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>).
Sometimes, you might want to wait (with <w>$cmd[CMD_MOVE_NOWHERE]</w>)
for a monster to step on it before doing so.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk

Against particularly tough foes, you may want to use
Trog's Berserk power with <w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w><localtiles>
or via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 exhaustion

A berserker rage is truly exhausting. While fatigued,
you cannot berserk again and are also slowed.
It's best to rest with <w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w>
<localtiles>(or via the <w>command panel</w>)</localtiles>
until you feel fit again.
%%%%
tutorial5 hunger

You cannot berserk while very hungry, so you should
always carry some food with you. This means that
sometimes you'll have to decide between butchering
a corpse or sacrificing it to Trog.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk2

Berserk is also really useful against multiple enemies
— as long as you don't run out of steam in-between.

tutorial5 tutorial_end
