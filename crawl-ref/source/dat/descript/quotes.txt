An opulent altar of Gozag

“Mother, I kneel before gold,
 my lover and beloved;
 and knowing I adore him,
 he turns melancholic yellow.
 Because he follows his every lust
 whether doubloon or dust,
 a mighty knight
 is Don Dinero.”

calcifying dust cloud

“There is shadow under this red rock,

 And I will show you something different from either
 Your shadow at morning striding behind you
 Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
 I will show you fear in a handful of dust.”

A faded altar of an unknown god

“Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I

 beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN
 GOD.”

A gateway to Hell

“I am the way into the city of woe.
 I am the way to a forsaken people.
 I am the way into eternal sorrow.

 Sacred justice moved my architect.
 I was raised here by divine omnipotence,
 Primordial love and ultimate intellect.

 Only those elements time cannot wear
 Were made before me, and beyond time I stand.
 Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”

A granite statue

“I met a traveller from an antique land
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
 Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
 Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown
 And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
 Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,
 The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
 And on the pedestal these words appear:
 ‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
 Nothing beside remains: round the decay
 Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
 The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
    -Percy Bysshe Shelley, “Ozymandias”. 1818.

A one-way gate to the infinite horrors of the Abyss

“And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.”

“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you'd generally
 get to somewhere else — if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been
 doing.” “A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now here, you see, it takes
 all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get
 somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”
    -Lewis Carroll, _Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There_,
ch. 2 “The Garden of Live Flowers”. 1871.
%%%%
The open sea

“I mused upon the mystery of fish, their strange and mindless beauty, how—
 innocently evil—they prey upon each other, devouring the weaker and smaller
 without rage or shout or change of countenance. There, in the realm of water,
 which is also earth and air to them, the great fish passed up and down,
 growing old without aging and enjoying eternal growth without the softness of
 obesity. It was a world without morality, a world without choices, a world of
 eating and spawning and growing great. I envied the great fish, and (in other,
 smaller ponds) the lesser fish, darting and flashing and sparkling gold.

 They speak of ‘the beast in man,’ and of ‘the law of the jungle.’ Might they
 not (so I reflected, strolling underneath a sky of clouds as blue and as white
 as the tiles and marble of the Altar of Heaven), might they not better speak
 of ‘the fish in man’? And of ‘the law of the sea’? The sea, from which they
 say we came...?”
    -Avram Davidson, “Dagon”, 1959.

A portal to a secret trove of treasure

“He saw a large cavern and a vaulted [roof], in height equalling the stature
 of a full-grown man and it was hewn in the live stone and lighted up with
 light that came through air-holes and bullseyes in the upper surface of the
 rock which formed the roof. He had expected to find naught save outer gloom in
 this robbers' den, and he was surprised to see the whole room filled with
 bales of all manner stuffs, and heaped up from sole to ceiling with
 camel-loads of silks and brocades and embroidered cloths and mounds on mounds
 of vari-colored carpetings; besides which he espied coins golden and silvern
 without measure or account, some piled upon the ground and others bound in
 leathern bags and sacks. Seeing these goods and moneys in such abundance, Ali
 Baba determined in his mind that not during a few years only but for many
 generations thieves must have stored their gains and spoils in this place.”
    -_The Arabian Nights_. trans. Sir Richard F. Burton, 1885.

A portal to somewhere

“The hole now stood some three meters in diameter beginning from the dais -
 though its outline shrank and dilated slightly like a pulsing, living thing.
 Through it we could see shapes seething and changing constantly with the
 colors and the light. Purple trees grew upside down from a pink sky, changing
 into black flowers and the flowers into feathery tongues of giant yellow worms
 lumbering over a shaking, exploding desert. It was as if the world couldn't
 make up its mind what to be yet. Looking at the scene for even a moment gave
 me a headache, and anyone looking at it for long would surely go mad.”
    -Laurence Yep, _Dragon War_. 1992.

A rock wall

“I know not whether Laws be right,
   Or whether Laws be wrong;
 All that we know who lie in gaol

 And that each day is like a year,
   A year whose days are long.”
    -Oscar Wilde, “The Ballad of Reading Gaol”. 1898.

A sacrificial altar of Ru

“Then I began taking off my hands. I put them in the top drawer. I removed my
 feet and put them into the closet, along with my legs. I put my head in a box
 and hung my torso up on a hanger. Then I walked out of the apartment, climbed
 up the stairs to the roof. I opened the door and stepped out into a beautiful
 green meadow.”
    -Celestial Navigations, “The Sniper”. 1995.

A shaft

“Gravity, a mere nuisance to Christian, was a terror to Pope, Pagan, and
 Despair. To the mouse and any smaller animal it presents practically no
 dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on
 arriving at the bottom it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided
 that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a
 horse splashes.”

Abyss

“Out here in the zones, you never even knew when your bone marrow might book an
 exotic vacation and neglect to invite you along. Thinking square thoughts under
 a violet endomoon could redefine every third cell in your body as a verb. There
 were sneakers that ate feet, bifocals that ate eyeballs, strawberry yogurt that
 ate small intestines. Farther out there, _so_ much farther, there were
 wavelengths of something ancestral to light that could crawl into your past and
 eat the day you were born.

 Nobody so much as batted an eye or quivered a flange when these things happened
 to the unnaturally branchinated, the puzzling and comical tourists that blipped
 in and out from the forgettable grey. Things like herself, or Fern, or the
 plank maze loser were little more than _weird bugs_ to most entities, a quaint
 curiosity at best and more often an unwanted parasite. Infinite layers of
 reality, and it still felt, in the worst way, like she'd never left home.”
    -Jonathan Wojcik, _Awful Hospital_. 2021.
%%%%
Desolation

“In the salt mines
 I saw the salt
 in this shaker.
 I know you won’t believe me,
 but there
 it sings,
 the salt sings, the skin
 of the salt mines
 sings
 with a mouth choking
 on dirt.
 Alone
 when I heard
 the voice
 of salt,
 I trembled
 in the empty
 desert.
 Near Antafagusta
 the whole
 salted plain
 shouts out
 in its
 cracked
 voice
 a pitiful
 song.”

Elven Halls

“Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.
 Elves are marvelous. They cause marvels.
 Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.
 Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.
 Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.
 Elves are terrific. They beget terror.
 The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you
 want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning.
 No one ever said elves are _nice_.
 Elves are _bad_.”
    -Terry Pratchett, _Lords and Ladies_. 1992.

Orcish Mines

“You load sixteen tons, what do you get
 Another day older and deeper in debt
 Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
 I owe my soul to the company store.”

Shoals

“I often think about that old metaphor, the one that says we are all islands on
 a wide sea. Especially these days, now that things are more difficult than
 before and the world appears to be harsher than we once imagined it to be.

 We are all like islands, the philosopher said. Perhaps it's true. Yet I cannot
 help but remember an older saying scratched on a cave wall somewhere by a
 long- forgotten prophet: In the end the sea will claim everything.

 The ancient words crash into my mind like waves, waking me from sleep, filling
 me with feelings I cannot fully understand. We are like islands. Does it mean
 we are connected? Do we share a common origin? Or just the common fate of
 sinking?”
    -“The Sea Will Claim Everything”. 2012.

Tartarus

“There is a drear and lonely tract of hell
 From all the common gloom removed afar:
 A flat, sad land it is, where shadows are,

Tomb

“In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the
 lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence,
 and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But sometimes, and oftenest
 at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open. In an hour like this,
 when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength; when the
 imagination is a mirror, imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power
 of selecting or controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and
 the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain.”
    -Nathaniel Hawthorne, “The Haunted Mind”. 1835.

Alistair's Walking Alembic spell

Despite its unwieldy appearance, it is widely considered Alistair's most popular
work; countless variations of this spell can be found in surface libraries,
customised to prepare everything from floor polish to vegetable soup. In the

Animate Dead spell

“Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more
 certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true. Some
 miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct

 succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became
 myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.”

Call Canine Familiar spell

“There seemed a strange stillness over everything. But as I listened, I heard
 as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's
 eyes gleamed, and he said.

 ‘Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!’ Seeing, I

 cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes, and before I

“I fumbled to the window to experience the world
 And to hear my Madness singing, sitting on the kerbstone

Dragon's Call spell

“This is where the dragons went.
 They lie...
 Not dead, not asleep. Not waiting, because waiting implies expectation.
 Possibly the word we're looking for here is...
 ...dormant.
 And although the space they occupy isn't like normal space, nevertheless
   they are packed in tightly. Not a cubic inch there but is filled by a claw,
   a talon, a scale, the tip of a tail, so the effect is like one of those
   trick drawings and your eyeballs eventually realise that the space between
   each dragon is, in fact, another dragon.
 They could put you in mind of a can of sardines, if you thought sardines

Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

“Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines

 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray
 thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at
 once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and
 on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other
 with his left.

 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with
 all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that
 were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which
 he slew in his life.”

Mercury Arrow spell

“During the course of the treatise, each element is allowed time to tout its
 own virtues and usefulness to mankind, but when it comes time for Mercury,
 he announces that he presides over all of the beings that have come before
 him. Mercury is mother and father. He gives other metals their splendor and
 makes them useful to humanity. Without Mercury, the other metals would have no
 (use) value. Perhaps a seat on the throne would restrict him to a fixed
 position of sovereignty. He reigns, but he must be mobile.”

Nazja's Percussive Tempering spell

Sacrifice Love ability

“Every thing is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin;
 the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it
 is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is
 given, in language which painted your own horrors, and rendered mine
 ineffaceable. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I
 exclaimed in agony. ‘Cursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that
 even you turned from me in disgust? God in pity made man beautiful and
 alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more
 horrid from its very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to

Summon Seismosaurus Egg spell

Zoologists famously considered this animal to have been extinct for centuries
until copies of this spell were unearthed among the affairs of a misanthropic
hermit who'd finally made the wrong noble's hair fall out.

Several well-funded expeditions were launched in the wake of the discovery, but

 ‘Do not strike off my head,’ said Karen, ‘for if you do I cannot repent of my

 And then she confessed all her sin, and the Executioner cut off her feet with
 the red shoes; but the shoes danced away with the little feet over the fields

 And he cut her a pair of wooden feet, with crutches, and taught her a psalm,

“Beside the man stands a woman - of sorts. Her emulation of the human gender is
 only superficial, a courtesy. Likewise the loose drapelike dress she wears is
 not cloth. She has simply shaped a portion of her stiff substance to suit the
 preferences of the fragile, mortal creatures among whom she currently moves.
 From a distance the illusion would work to pass her off as a woman standing
 still...

 When she turns to the man - slowly; stone eaters are slow aboveground, except
 when they aren't - this movement pushes her beyond artful beauty into something
 altogether different. The man has grown used to it, but even so, he does not
 look at her. He does not want revulsion to spoil the moment.”

diamond obelisk

“As one example of the meanings inherent in a form, let us examine a particular
 form of vertical stone marker, variously called stele, obelisk, standing-stone,
 and memorial column. These have been historically and commonly used to
 commemorate honored phenomena. So, when a people wish to remember an important
 relationship, event or personage, a location is dedicated to it and often
 marked with an enduring and aspiring vertical form or sets of them. In natural
 language, a vertical stone means: an aspiring connector between us (on earth)
 and an ideal (up there); that we ‘stand up’ with pride about this honored
 phenomenon. The marker is a symbolic inhabitation of the place it occupies. Its
 size and workmanship is a sacrifice of much work and resources to a memory. It
 is a strong suggestion (because we left it to them and it is of durable
 material) that future people also give honor to the memorialized phenomenon.
 When we use this particular physical form of the vertical marker, both its
 historic use as an honorific and its meanings in natural language may well send
 a message that this is an honored place, a place about a ‘good’ both in our
 culture and in the culture of future observers.”

 The only way that the solid can initialize its architectonic and compositional
 activities (processes for survival, development, etc.) is by letting the void
 in. The dynamic traits of solid can only be actuated when solid is eaten,
 convoluted and messed up by the void. There is no other option for solid.”
