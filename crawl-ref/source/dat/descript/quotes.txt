“When Peleus, some distance away, saw him torn apart by the frightful wound he
shouted: ‘Accept this tribute to the dead, at least, Crantor, dearest of
youths’, and with his powerful arm, he hurled his ash spear, at full strength,
at Demoleon. It ruptured the ribcage, and stuck quivering in the bone. The
centaur pulled out the shaft minus its head (he tried with difficulty to reach
that also) but the head was caught in his lung. The pain itself strengthened
his will: wounded, he reared up at his enemy and beat the hero down with his
hooves. Peleus received the resounding blows on helmet and shield, and
defending his upper arms, and controlling the weapon he held out, with one blow
through the arm he pierced the bi-formed breast.”

blowgun

“Along the Upper Caiary-Uaupes blow-guns are made from the stems of a variety
of palm (Iriartea setigera Martius)... The Indian selects two stems of such
sizes that the smaller will exactly fit within the larger. After these stems
have been carefully dried and the pith cleared out with a long rod, the bore is
made smooth by drawing back and forth through it a little bunch of tree-fern
roots. The smaller stem is then inserted in the larger, so that one will serve
to correct any crookedness that may exist in the other. The wooden mouth-piece
is then fitted to one end, and about three and one half feet from it, a boar's
tooth is fastened on the gun by some gummy substance, for a sight. Over the
outside the maker winds spirally a strip of the dark shiny bark of a creeper
which gives it an ornamental finish, and his blow-gun is complete.
 ”The arrows are from ten to fourteen inches long, and of the thickness of an
ordinary lucifer match. Those of the Indians of the Caiary-Uaupes are made from
the midrib of a palm leaf or of the spinous processes of the Patawa (Enocarpus
Batawa) sharpened to a point at one end and wound near the other with a
delicate sort of wild cotton which grows in a pod upon a large tree (Bombax
ceiba). This mass of cotton is just big enough to fill the tube when the arrow
is gently pressed into it. The point is dipped into poison, allowed to dry, and
redipped until well coated. The exact composition of this poison is unknown,
and probably varies in different localities; but it would seem that the chief
ingredient is always the juice of a Strychnos plant. It is known among
different tribes by many names; such as Curari, Ourari, Urari and Woorali.”

 Right into my empty tumbler straight the little devil bore,
 Squatted, grinned and nothing more.

 There the little imp sat grinning at me while my head went spinning,
 So that had I not sat down I should have fallen upon the floor;
 ‘Though thy looks be somewhat evil,’ said I ”tell me thou blue devil,
 Wherefore holdest though thy revel in the glass that held before
 Much the more agreeable spirit,—mizzle! leave me as before.“
 Then the imp said ‘Never-more!’

 Though I felt uncommon funky, still this answer put my monkey
 Up, and at the small blue devil in an undertone I swore.
 Then I said I must be dreaming, although broad awake I'm seeming;
 Doubtless I shall have a screaming morning headache — what a bore:

which he laid a parchment with the unutterable name of God written on it. The
clod immediately arose and was a man; he performed all the duties of a servant
for his creator, he fetched water, and hewed wood. All through the Jews quarter
he was known as the Golem of the great Rabbi Löw. Every Friday evening the
Rabbi took the parchment out of his head, and he was clay until Sunday morning.
Once the Rabbi forgot this duty, all were in the Synagogue, the Sabbath hymn
was begun, when all the women and children in the assembly started and screamed
out, ‘the Golem! the Golem is destroying everything!’ The Rabbi ordered the
precentor to pause at the end of the prayer: it was yet possible to save all,
but later nought would avail, the whole world would be destroyed. He hastened
home, and saw the Golem already seizing the joists of his house to tear down
the building: he sprang forward, took the parchment out, and dead clay again
lay at his feet.”

 When midnight comes, lending silence to sleep,
 And all the dogs and hedgerow birds are quiet,
 He who remembers ancient rites, and fears the gods,
 Rises (no fetters binding his two feet)
 And makes the sign with thumb and closed fingers,
 Lest an insubstantial shade meets him in the silence.
 After cleansing his hands in spring water,
 He turns and first taking some black beans,
 Throws them with averted face: saying, while throwing:
 ‘With these beans I throw I redeem me and mine.’
 He says this nine times without looking back: the shade
 Is thought to gather the beans, and follow behind, unseen.
 Again he touches water, and sounds the Temesan bronze,
 And asks the spirit to leave his house.
 When nine times he’s cried: ‘Ancestral spirit, depart,’
 He looks back, and believes the sacred rite’s fulfilled.”

 The angel's heart froze to ice

 Touch the snow... Caress the lifeless sculptures

quarterstaff

“Then Robin he unbuckled his belt,
 And laid down his bow so long;
 He took up a staff of another oak graff,
 That was both stiff and strong.
 ‘But let me measure,’ said jolly Robin,
 ‘Before we begin our fray;
 For I'll not have mine to be longer than thine,
 For that will be counted foul play.’
 ‘I pass not for length,’ bold Arthur replied,
 ‘My staff is of oak so free;
 Eight foot and a half it will knock down a calf,
 And I hope it will knock down thee.’
 Then Robin could no longer forbear,
 He gave him such a knock,
 Quickly and soon the blood came down,
 Before it was ten o'clock.
 About and about and about they went,
 Like two wild boars in a chase,
 Striving to aim each other to maim,
 Leg, arm, or any other place.
 And knock for knock they hastily dealt,
 Which held for two hours and more;
 That all the wood rang at every bang,
 They plied their work so sore.”

the Lernaean hydra

“The second Labour which he undertook was the slaying of the Lernaian Hydra,
 springing from whose single body were fashioned a hundred necks, each bearing
 the head of a serpent. And when one head was cut off, the place where it was
 severed put forth two others; for this reason it was considered to be
 invincible, and with good reason, since the part of it which was subdued sent
 forth a two-fold assistance in its place. Against a thing so difficult to
 manage as this Herakles devised an ingenious scheme and commanded Iolaos to
 sear with a burning brand the part which had been severed, in order to check
 the flow of the blood.”

titan

“And on the other part the Titans eagerly strengthened their ranks, and both
sides at one time showed the work of their hands and their might. The boundless
sea rang terribly around, and the earth crashed loudly: wide Heaven was shaken
and groaned, and high Olympus reeled from its foundation under the charge of
the undying gods, and a heavy quaking reached dim Tartarus and the deep sound
of their feet in the fearful onset and of their hard missiles. So, then, they
launched their grievous shafts upon one another, and the cry of both armies as
they shouted reached to starry heaven; and they met together with a great
battle-cry.”

“Without noticing the occupations of an intervening day or two, which, as they

nothing sufficiently interesting to detain the reader, we pass to one in some
degree peculiar to Scotland, which may be called a sort of salmon-hunting. This
chase, in which the fish is pursued and struck with barbed spears, or a sort of
long shafted trident, called a waster, is much practised at the mouth of the
Esk, and in the other salmon rivers of Scotland.”

“THE TROLL KING: Now, listen, Prince Peer, and give way to reason!
 You're cut out for a Troll. Why, look, already
 You bear yourself quite in a Troll-like fashion!
 And you want to become one, don't you?
 PEER GYNT: Of course.
 In return for a bride and a well-found kingdom
 I'm not unwilling to sacrifice something;
 But all things have their natural limit.
 I have taken a tail, it is true; but, then,
 I can undo the knots that our friend has tied
 And take the thing off. I have shed my breeches;
 They were old and patched; but that won't prevent me
 From putting them on if I have a mind to.
 I shall probably find it just as easy
 To deal with your Trollish way of living.
 I can easily swear that a cow's a maiden;
 An oath's not a difficult thing to swallow.
 But to know that one never can get one's freedom —
 Not even to die as a human being —
 To end one's days as a Troll of the mountains —
 Never go back, as you tell me plainly —
 That is a thing that I'll not submit to.”

“Gentlemen, I see that you wish to remain within doors,” she said, wrapping
around her head a red cashmere shawl, “but I am going for mushrooms: follow me
who will!” Under one arm she took the little daughter of the Chamberlain, with
the other she raised her skirt up to her ankles. Thaddeus silently hastened

“He fixed his eyes upon the door, which, slowly opening, disclosed a stranger
of majestic form, but scowling features, who demanded sternly, why he was
summoned? ‘I did not summon you,’ said the trembling student. ‘You did!’ said
the stranger, advancing, angrily; ‘and the demons are not to be invoked in
vain.’ The student could make no reply; and the demon, enraged that one of the
uninitiated should have summoned him out of mere presumption, seized him by the
throat and strangled him.

When Agrippa returned, a few days afterwards, he found his house beset with
devils. Some of them were sitting on the chimneypots, kicking up their legs in

zombie

“It seemed that while the zombie came from the grave, it was neither a ghost,
nor yet a person who had been raised like Lazarus from the dead. The zombie,
they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and
endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life—it is a dead body which
is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive. People who have the power
to do this go to a fresh grave, dig up the body before it has had time to rot,
galvanize it into movement, and then make of it a servant or slave,
occasionally for the commission of some crime, more often simply as a drudge
around the habitation or the farm, setting it dull heavy tasks, and beating it
like a dumb beast if it slackens.”
