An opulent altar of Gozag

“Mother, I kneel before gold,
 my lover and beloved;
 and knowing I adore him,
 he turns melancholic yellow.
 Because he follows his every lust
 whether doubloon or dust,
 a mighty knight
 is Don Dinero.”
    -Francisco de Quevedo, _Poderoso caballero es don Dinero_. 1603.

 Your shadow at morning striding behind you
 Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
 I will show you fear in a handful of dust.”

A faded altar of an unknown god

 GOD.”
    -KJV Bible, Acts 17:22-23.

“We made an expedition;

A gateway to Hell

“I am the way into the city of woe.
 I am the way to a forsaken people.
 I am the way into eternal sorrow.

 Sacred justice moved my architect.
 I was raised here by divine omnipotence,
 Primordial love and ultimate intellect.

 Only those elements time cannot wear
 Were made before me, and beyond time I stand.
 Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”

%%%%
A granite statue

“I met a traveller from an antique land
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
 Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
 Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown
 And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
 Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,
 The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
 And on the pedestal these words appear:
 ‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
 Nothing beside remains: round the decay
 Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
 The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
    -Percy Bysshe Shelley, “Ozymandias”. 1818.

A one-way gate to the infinite horrors of the Abyss

“And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.”

“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you'd generally
 get to somewhere else — if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been
 doing.” “A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now here, you see, it takes
 all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get
 somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”
    -Lewis Carroll, _Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There_,
ch. 2 “The Garden of Live Flowers”. 1871.
%%%%
The open sea

“I mused upon the mystery of fish, their strange and mindless beauty, how—
 innocently evil—they prey upon each other, devouring the weaker and smaller
 without rage or shout or change of countenance. There, in the realm of water,
 which is also earth and air to them, the great fish passed up and down,
 growing old without aging and enjoying eternal growth without the softness of
 obesity. It was a world without morality, a world without choices, a world of
 eating and spawning and growing great. I envied the great fish, and (in other,
 smaller ponds) the lesser fish, darting and flashing and sparkling gold.

 They speak of ‘the beast in man,’ and of ‘the law of the jungle.’ Might they
 not (so I reflected, strolling underneath a sky of clouds as blue and as white
 as the tiles and marble of the Altar of Heaven), might they not better speak
 of ‘the fish in man’? And of ‘the law of the sea’? The sea, from which they
 say we came...?”
    -Avram Davidson, “Dagon”, 1959.

A portal to a secret trove of treasure

“He saw a large cavern and a vaulted [roof], in height equalling the stature
 of a full-grown man and it was hewn in the live stone and lighted up with
 light that came through air-holes and bullseyes in the upper surface of the
 rock which formed the roof. He had expected to find naught save outer gloom in
 this robbers' den, and he was surprised to see the whole room filled with
 bales of all manner stuffs, and heaped up from sole to ceiling with
 camel-loads of silks and brocades and embroidered cloths and mounds on mounds
 of vari-colored carpetings; besides which he espied coins golden and silvern
 without measure or account, some piled upon the ground and others bound in
 leathern bags and sacks. Seeing these goods and moneys in such abundance, Ali
 Baba determined in his mind that not during a few years only but for many
 generations thieves must have stored their gains and spoils in this place.”
    -_The Arabian Nights_. trans. Sir Richard F. Burton, 1885.

A rock wall

“I know not whether Laws be right,
   Or whether Laws be wrong;
 All that we know who lie in gaol
   Is that the wall is strong;
 And that each day is like a year,
   A year whose days are long.”
    -Oscar Wilde, “The Ballad of Reading Gaol”. 1898.
%%%%
A sacrificial altar of Ru

“Then I began taking off my hands. I put them in the top drawer. I removed my
 feet, and put them into the closet, along with my legs. I put my head in a box,
 and hung my torso up on a hanger. Then I walked out of the apartment, climbed
 up the stairs to the roof. I opened the door, and stepped out into a beautiful
 green meadow.”
    -Celestial Navigations, “The Sniper”, 1995.

A shaft

“Gravity, a mere nuisance to Christian, was a terror to Pope, Pagan, and
 Despair. To the mouse and any smaller animal it presents practically no
 dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on
 arriving at the bottom it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided
 that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a
 horse splashes.”

Abyss

“Out here in the zones, you never even knew when your bone marrow might book an
 exotic vacation and neglect to invite you along. Thinking square thoughts under
 a violet endomoon could redefine every third cell in your body as a verb. There
 were sneakers that ate feet, bifocals that ate eyeballs, strawberry yogurt that
 ate small intestines. Farther out there, _so_ much farther, there were
 wavelengths of something ancestral to light that could crawl into your past and
 eat the day you were born.

 Nobody so much as batted an eye or quivered a flange when these things happened
 to the unnaturally branchinated, the puzzling and comical tourists that blipped
 in and out from the forgettable grey. Things like herself, or Fern, or the
 plank maze loser were little more than _weird bugs_ to most entities, a quaint
 curiosity at best and more often an unwanted parasite. Infinite layers of
 reality, and it still felt, in the worst way, like she'd never left home.”
    -Jonathan Wojcik, _Awful Hospital_. 2021.
%%%%
Desolation

“In the salt mines
 I saw the salt
 in this shaker.
 I know you won’t believe me,
 but there
 it sings,
 the salt sings, the skin
 of the salt mines
 sings
 with a mouth choking
 on dirt.
 Alone
 when I heard
 the voice
 of salt,
 I trembled
 in the empty
 desert.
 Near Antafagusta
 the whole
 salted plain
 shouts out
 in its
 cracked
 voice
 a pitiful
 song.”
    -Pablo Neruda, “Ode to Salt”, 1957.
     trans. Philip Levine, published 2013

Elven Halls

“Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.
 Elves are marvelous. They cause marvels.
 Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.
 Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.
 Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.
 Elves are terrific. They beget terror.
 The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you
 want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning.
 No one ever said elves are _nice_.
 Elves are _bad_.”
    -Terry Pratchett, _Lords and Ladies_. 1992.

Orcish Mines

“You load sixteen tons, what do you get
 Another day older and deeper in debt
 Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
 I owe my soul to the company store.”

%%%%
Shoals

“I often think about that old metaphor, the one that says we are all islands on
 a wide sea. Especially these days, now that things are more difficult than
 before and the world appears to be harsher than we once imagined it to be.

 We are all like islands, the philosopher said. Perhaps it's true. Yet I cannot
 help but remember an older saying scratched on a cave wall somewhere by a
 long- forgotten prophet: In the end the sea will claim everything.

 The ancient words crash into my mind like waves, waking me from sleep, filling
 me with feelings I cannot fully understand. We are like islands. Does it mean
 we are connected? Do we share a common origin? Or just the common fate of
 sinking?”
    -“The Sea Will Claim Everything”. 2012.

Tartarus

“There is a drear and lonely tract of hell
 From all the common gloom removed afar:
 A flat, sad land it is, where shadows are,
 Whose lorn estate my verse may never tell.”

Tomb

“In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the
 lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence,
 and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But sometimes, and oftenest
 at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open. In an hour like this,
 when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength; when the
 imagination is a mirror, imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power
 of selecting or controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and
 the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain.”
    -Nathaniel Hawthorne, “The Haunted Mind”. 1835.

Dragon's Call spell

“This is where the dragons went.
 They lie...
 Not dead, not asleep. Not waiting, because waiting implies expectation.
 Possibly the word we're looking for here is...
 ...dormant.
 And although the space they occupy isn't like normal space, nevertheless
   they are packed in tightly. Not a cubic inch there but is filled by a claw,
   a talon, a scale, the tip of a tail, so the effect is like one of those
   trick drawings and your eyeballs eventually realise that the space between
   each dragon is, in fact, another dragon.
 They could put you in mind of a can of sardines, if you thought sardines

“Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines
 were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women,

 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray
 thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at
 once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and
 on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other
 with his left.

 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with
 all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that
 were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which
 he slew in his life.”

 ineffaceable. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I
 exclaimed in agony. ‘Cursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that
 even you turned from me in disgust? God in pity made man beautiful and
 alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more

 big bombs, maniac politicians, huge earthquakes, or vast population movements,
 but it has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by
 people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that really change
 the world, according to Chaos theory, are the tiny things. A butterfly flaps
 its wings in the Amazonian jungle, and subsequently a storm ravages half of
 Europe...”

 But all things have their natural limit.
 I have taken a tail, it is true; but, then,

 And take the thing off. I have shed my breeches;
 They were old and patched; but that won't prevent me
 From putting them on if I have a mind to.
 I shall probably find it just as easy
 To deal with your Trollish way of living.
 I can easily swear that a cow's a maiden;
 An oath's not a difficult thing to swallow.
 But to know that one never can get one's freedom —
 Not even to die as a human being —
 To end one's days as a Troll of the mountains —
 Never go back, as you tell me plainly —

“But Sigmund turned him about, and he said: ‘What aileth thee, son?
 Shall our life-days never be merry, and our labour never be done?’

 But Sinfiotli said: ‘I have looked, and lo, there is death in the cup.’

 And the song, and the tinkling of harp-strings to the roof-tree winded up;
 And Sigmund was dreamy with wine and the wearing of many a year;
 And the noise and the glee of the people as the sound of the wild woods were
 And the blossoming boughs of the Branstock were the wild trees waving about;

 So he said: ‘Well seen, my fosterling; let the lip then strain it out.’”

“A MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the man whom he
 murdered. On his reaching the river Nile he saw a Lion on its bank and being
 fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. He found a serpent in the upper branches
 of the tree, and again being greatly alarmed, he threw himself into the river,
 where a crocodile caught him and ate him. Thus the earth, the air, and the
 water alike refused shelter to a murderer.”

Tiamat

“He saith that Tiamat our mother hath conceived a hatred for us,
 With all her force she rageth, full of wrath.
 All the gods have turned to her,
 With those, whom ye created, they go at her side.
 They are banded together, and at the side of Tiamat they advance;
 They are furious, they devise mischief without resting night and day.
 They prepare for battle, fuming and raging;
 They have joined their forces and are making war.
 Tiamat who formed all things,
 Made in addition weapons invincible; she spawned monster-serpents,
 Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang;
 With poison, instead of blood, she filled their bodies.
 Fierce monster-vipers she clothed with terror,
 With splendor she decked them, she made them of lofty stature.
 Whoever beheld them, terror overcame him,
 Their bodies reared up and none could withstand their attack.”

Urug

“_Urug_, tumbled down, fallen by crumbling down. Slipped down, as earth from a
 hill-side, stones which have been piled up or the like. To fall as water at a
 cascade. To fill up a hollow by putting earth into it. To lay gravel or
 materials on a road. A landslip.

 _Ururugan_, apparently a plural form of 'Urug'. To go with a number of men to
 any work. To make war, to attack with an army. To set upon in numbers, as it
 were to tumble upon in masses.”

“Beside the man stands a woman - of sorts. Her emulation of the human gender is
 only superficial, a courtesy. Likewise the loose drapelike dress she wears is
 not cloth. She has simply shaped a portion of her stiff substance to suit the
 preferences of the fragile, mortal creatures among whom she currently moves.
 From a distance the illusion would work to pass her off as a woman standing
 still...

 When she turns to the man - slowly; stone eaters are slow aboveground, except
 when they aren't - this movement pushes her beyond artful beauty into something
 altogether different. The man has grown used to it, but even so, he does not
 look at her. He does not want revulsion to spoil the moment.”

 shouted: ‘Accept this tribute to the dead, at least, Crantor, dearest of
 youths’, and with his powerful arm, he hurled his ash spear, at full strength,
 at Demoleon. It ruptured the ribcage, and stuck quivering in the bone. The
 centaur pulled out the shaft minus its head (he tried with difficulty to reach
 that also) but the head was caught in his lung. The pain itself strengthened
 his will: wounded, he reared up at his enemy and beat the hero down with his

diamond obelisk

“As one example of the meanings inherent in a form, let us examine a particular
 form of vertical stone marker, variously called stele, obelisk, standing-stone,
 and memorial column. These have been historically and commonly used to
 commemorate honored phenomena. So, when a people wish to remember an important
 relationship, event or personage, a location is dedicated to it and often
 marked with an enduring and aspiring vertical form or sets of them. In natural
 language, a vertical stone means: an aspiring connector between us (on earth)
 and an ideal (up there); that we ‘stand up’ with pride about this honored
 phenomenon. The marker is a symbolic inhabitation of the place it occupies. Its
 size and workmanship is a sacrifice of much work and resources to a memory. It
 is a strong suggestion (because we left it to them and it is of durable
 material) that future people also give honor to the memorialized phenomenon.
 When we use this particular physical form of the vertical marker, both its
 historic use as an honorific and its meanings in natural language may well send
 a message that this is an honored place, a place about a ‘good’ both in our
 culture and in the culture of future observers.”

 constantly surrounded by innumerable small fishes, who serve as his food and

 Pontoppidan writes, lasts no longer than three months, and another three are
 then needed to digest it. His excrements nurture in the following an army of
 lesser fish, and for this reason, fishermen plumb after his resting place ...
 Gradually, Kraken ascends to the surface, and when he is at ten to twelve
 fathoms, the boats had better move out of his vicinity, as he will shortly
 thereafter burst up, like a floating island, spurting water from his dreadful

“After a while they came to a village. ”Now then,“ said Snapping Turtle, ”in
 the morning at daylight, my friends, we will make on attack. I myself will
 first go to the place,“ the leader of the war party said to them.

 ”Good,“ said the other little one, ”thou art the one who sees to it what we
 shall do,“ they said to that Snapping Turtle. ”Now then,“ said Snapping
 Turtle, ”verily I am now going to tell you what I shall do.“ Thus he spoke.
 ”Now is the time I shall begin to walk toward this village. Verily at the time
 I shall kill the daughter of the chief will be when the light of day is
 breaking, and at the same instant the sky will glow with red in the direction
 whence the morrow comes. ‘Ho, there, our comrade has killed her!’ will thus be
 the thought in your hearts. Then is the time when you want to make a great
 noise, when you shall whoop all keep it up. Now is the time that you go to
 attack this village.“ Thus he spoke to those his young men.

 ”All right!“ said the other little fellows.”

spatial maelstrom

“In any composition, the solid narrates the anomalies generated by the void, or
 the infection of the void through the solid (where the void comes to the solid,
 it works as a convoluting plague, a coiling swirling epidemic rather than a
 nullifying process or a solid-annihilating agent); in a composition there is no
 pure solid but a defiled one, a diseased and deflowered solid.
 [...]
 The only way that the solid can initialize its architectonic and compositional
 activities (processes for survival, development, etc.) is by letting the void
 in. The dynamic traits of solid can only be actuated when solid is eaten,
 convoluted and messed up by the void. There is no other option for solid.”

 then, they launched their grievous shafts upon one another, and the cry of
 both armies as they shouted reached to starry heaven; and they met together

 power to do this go to a fresh grave, dig up the body before it has had time
 to rot, galvanize it into movement, and then make of it a servant or slave,
 occasionally for the commission of some crime, more often simply as a drudge
 around the habitation or the farm, setting it dull heavy tasks, and beating it
 like a dumb beast if it slackens.”
