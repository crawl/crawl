%%%%
A gate to the Realm of Zot

This gate leads to the Realm of Zot, the final stage of your quest as its deepest level houses the infamous Orb of Zot.

%%%%
A gateway to a bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by travelling from place to place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain. Once you hear the clinking of coins, be sure to hurry up and find the impromptu marketplace before the caravan moves on!

Also be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave quickly, probably to sell them elsewhere.

An altar to Beogh, unmistakably roughly hewn by orcish artisans.

A shaft

A deep hole. Who knows where you might end up if you were to fall through it?
%%%%

%%%%

This altar constantly shimmers in all visible colours and probably some invisible ones, too, matching the whims of Xom the Unpredictable, to whom it is dedicated.
%%%%

An altar, ablaze in the lights of Iskenderun and promising great destructive powers to those who would follow Vehumet.
%%%%
A shop

%%%%
%%%%
A trap

It's a trap!
%%%%
A tree

While the dungeon is filled with dim magic light, in most places it is not bright enough to sustain any larger plants. It is uneven, though, and there are spots where, with the grace of Fedhas, trees as big as those on the surface can grow underground.
%%%%
A wall of green crystal

For some reason, some dungeon walls, like this one, have been made of this polished crystal, imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its easy destruction, and make it reflect heat and cold.

%%%%
An open door

A wooden door. You can close it by standing next to it and {{
if crawl.is_tiles() then

Some deep water

This water is as deep as it is dangerous. No sane traveller would try to set foot into it, apart from those who fly or swim. Let it be a warning for you: many confused adventurers found their death at the depths, and an untimely end of levitation drowned even more hopeful trespassers.
%%%%
Some lava

An intensely hot pool of molten rock, emitting clouds of sulphurous smoke.
%%%%
Some shallow water

This waist-deep, misty water makes movement and combat cumbersome for landlubbers - sometimes dangerous, but never directly fatal.
