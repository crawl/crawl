shapes and sizes, but only one remains alight, its slender flame wavering in the

giants and covered with bloodstains.
%%%%
A hide-covered altar of Uskayaw

giving it a resonant surface. Carvings on the side depict grouped figures that

A radiant altar of Vehumet

An altar, ablaze in the lights of Iskenderun and promising great destructive
powers to those who would follow Vehumet.

wouldn't hurt.
%%%%
A cache of meat

A stash of preserved meats of varied origins and preparations: strips of jerky,
lumpy smoked sausages, and indeterminate protein rations. You already carry as
much food as you will ever need for this journey, but this could offer the rare
chance to try out yak...

unlucky enough to step on it. You may find yourself thrown into the Abyss,

room, is a vast and terrible sea of impossible size.

Either that, or it's a blue wall.

invisibility, and increasing the accuracy of attacks against any illuminated
creatures.

the shadows, and decreasing the accuracy of attacks by those unattuned to the
shadows.

attack in melee to sometimes fail.

### Other effects
########################################################################
ice covered

This wall is covered in magical ice that freezes victims who wander nearby.
This damage bypasses any armour the target may have, and will slow cold-blooded
creatures. Each victim is only ever affected by one icy wall at a time.

The creator of this icy covering and any of their allies can walk safely past
this wall.
%%%%
awoken

This tree has been temporarily enchanted to grant it some limited motility,
allowing it to lash out out at any adjacent enemies of the creature who awoke
it.
%%%%
tree burning

It is susceptible to bolts of lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of
fire. The resulting blaze can flare up, spreading to areas nearby and igniting
other trees.
%%%%
mangrove burning

It is susceptible to bolts of lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of
fire. Mangroves do not burn as vigorously as normal trees, due to growing on
swampy terrain, and leave behind shallow water after they smoulder.
%%%%
demonic tree burning

It is susceptible to bolts of lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of
fire. Burning this tree releases a cloud of pure chaos instead of flames.
