giants and covered with bloodstains.
%%%%

giving it a resonant surface. Carvings on the side depict grouped figures that
could be dancing or loving or fighting.

A radiant altar of Vehumet

An altar, ablaze in the lights of Iskenderun and promising great destructive
powers to those who would follow Vehumet.

it would be roasted in no time.
%%%%
The floor

Nothing but the mythical salamander can cross this without flight.

normal speed, and avoid fumbling.

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a secretive

goods.

shouldn't hurt.
%%%%
A cache of fruit

A pile of assorted fruit, ranging from common dungeon staples like chokos and
snozzcumbers, to rarer treats such as apples and oranges. You already carry as
much food as you will ever need for this journey, but the occasional nibble
wouldn't hurt.
%%%%
A cache of meat

A stash of preserved meats of varied origins and preparations: strips of jerky,
lumpy smoked sausages, and indeterminate protein rations. You already carry as
much food as you will ever need for this journey, but this could offer the rare
chance to try out yak...

Zot is surely nearby, its power overspilling to cause this spectacular sight.

### Sprint
########################################################################
# sprint_mu
An open sea?

Though it exists in stark defiance of every conventional rule of physics and
geometry you know to be true, there can be no denying that here, in this tiny
room, is a vast and terrible sea of impossible size.

Either that, or it's a blue wall.
%%%%
# arena_sprint
A spawn point

An entrance that the opposition may appear from.

### Area effects
########################################################################
haloed

This area is lit by a divine halo, decreasing your stealth, preventing
invisibility, and increasing the accuracy of attacks against any illuminated
creatures.
%%%%
umbraed

This area is wreathed by an umbra, improving your stealth if you are attuned to
the shadows, and decreasing the accuracy of attacks by those unattuned to the
shadows.
%%%%
liquefied

The ground here is liquefied, making movement slow and causing any attempts to
attack in melee to sometimes fail.
%%%%
disjunction haloed

This area is bathed in translocational energy, causing creatures to blink away
from the originator of the energy with an increasing chance the closer they are
to the caster.
%%%%
########################################################################
### Other effects
########################################################################
ice covered

This wall is covered in magical ice that freezes victims who wander nearby.
This damage bypasses any armour the target may have, and will slow cold-blooded
creatures. Each victim is only ever affected by one icy wall at a time.

The creator of this icy covering and any of their allies can walk safely past
this wall.
%%%%
awoken

This tree has been temporarily enchanted to grant it some limited motility,
allowing it to lash out out at any adjacent enemies of the creature who awoke
it.
%%%%
tree burning

It is susceptible to bolts of lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of
fire. The resulting blaze can flare up, spreading to areas nearby and igniting
other trees.
%%%%
mangrove burning

It is susceptible to bolts of lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of
fire. Mangroves do not burn as vigorously as normal trees, due to growing on
swampy terrain, and leave behind shallow water after they smoulder.
%%%%
demonic tree burning

It is susceptible to bolts of lightning and to sufficiently intense sources of
fire. Burning this tree releases a cloud of pure chaos instead of flames.
