A flickering gateway to a bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the 
dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by traveling from place 
to place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better 
stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain. 
Once you hear the clinking of coins, be sure to hurry up and find the 
impromptu marketplace before the carawan moves on!

Also be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to 
appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave 
quickly, probably to sell them elsewhere.
%%%%
A fountain of clear blue water

'q'uaff to drink from this fountain. But it's far more pretty than useful, unless you're trying to fetch the Orb without eating, I guess.
%%%%
A fountain of blood

'q'uaff to drink from this fountain, if you absolutely wish to.
%%%%
A fountain of sparkling water

'q'uaff to drink from this magic fountain. Expect magical effects, as long as it's still magic.

A granite statue

"I met a traveller from an antique land
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
 Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
 Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown
 And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
 Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,
 The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
 And on the pedestal these words appear:
 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
 Nothing beside remains: round the decay
 Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
 The lone and level sands stretch far away."
    -Percy Bysshe Shelley, "Ozymandias".  1818.
%%%%
A labyrinth entrance

A gateway to an intricate maze designed by subtle and malicious minds,
its exit guarded by a fearsome monster, where many a hapless
adventurer has lost his way and starved to death.

"Maze-treaders, whose vision ahead and behind is severely constricted and fragmented, suffer confusion, whereas maze-viewers who see the pattern whole, from above or in a diagram, are dazzled by its complex artistry. What you see depends on where you stand, and thus, at one and the same time, labyrinths are single (there is one physical structure) and double: they simultaneously incorporate order and disorder, clarity and confusion, unity and multiplicity, artistry and chaos."
        -Mark Z. Danielewski, "House of Leaves".  2000.

A one-way gate to the infinite horrors of the Abyss

A one-way gate to a demon-haunted realm, riven by chaos, its very
substance impermanent and whimsical, filled with creatures out
of nightmare.

"And if you gaze for long into an abyss,
 the abyss gazes also into you."
    -Friedrich Nietzsche, "Beyond Good and Evil"
%%%%
A rock wall

"I know not whether Laws be right,
   Or whether Laws be wrong;
 All that we know who lie in gaol
   Is that the wall is strong;
 And that each day is like a year,
   A year whose days are long."
    -Oscar Wilde, "Ballad of Reading Gaol"

%%%%
A shop

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a
secretive and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with,

Some shops hawk antiques of unknown provenance, and offer little hint
as to the quality or nature of their goods.

Any trace of intelligent beings has long been dissolved. Still, 
there are rumours of great treasures deep down, hidden safely away
in secret chambers without door or window for acid to leak in.
%%%%

A staircase to the Swamp

large slavering carnivorous monsters.
%%%%
A staircase to the Tomb

A way to the Tomb of the Ancients, a place of damnation, of horrors
animated by the vilest necromancy.

"In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though
the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their
existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But
sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung
wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive
sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror,
imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or
controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the
brotherhood of remorse not break their chain."
    -Nathaniel Hawthorne

A wall of green crystal

For some reason, some dungeon walls, like this one, have been made of this polished crystal, imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its destruction, and make it reflect heat and cold.
%%%%
A wall of solid wax

These walls are built by bees. Occasionally a dungeon architect will
manipulate bees into building wax walls for aesthetic reasons. (Theirs,
not the bees'.) They are susceptible to fire and will melt and burn, given
sufficient heat.
