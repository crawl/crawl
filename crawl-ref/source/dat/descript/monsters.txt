exotic weapon and astonishing speed both speak to the training she received
there. Underestimate her at your peril!
%%%%
Aizul

Once the primary guardian serpent of a legendary treasure hoard, she was
disgraced after thieves looted it while she slept. She now slithers about the
dungeon, seeking vengeance against all would-be looters. She is an accomplished
spellcaster, but no more deadly in melee combat than others of her kind.
%%%%
Antaeus

Once a mighty and renowned titan, his arrogance was his undoing. Now he is
corrupt and tainted, a powerful demon who lords over the frozen wastes of
Cocytus. His strength is legendary.
%%%%
Arachne

Once a talented human weaver, Arachne was cursed by being transformed into her
present form: half-human, half-spider. Her sympathies now lie with the inhuman
residents of her new home, and she's eager to dispose of any who would threaten
them.

Asmodeus

One of the arch-demons who dwell in the depths of Hell, wreathed in fire.
%%%%
Asterion

Once a king infamous for waging bloodthirsty campaigns, Asterion was exiled to
the depths of the dungeon for his crimes. Here he lurks in his tattered finery,
dreaming of a new kingdom. In his lust for power, the minotaur king turned to
the worship of Makhleb, and Makhleb has rewarded him with horrifying
destructive might.
%%%%
Azrael

A powerful, belligerent efreet. (Is there any other kind?)
%%%%
Bai Suzhen

A weary draconian with foreign and watery scales. She has come to the Dungeon
in hopes of resurrecting her mortal husband; a noble cause, for a being once
known for quarreling with saints and flooding unfortunate temples. If pressed
to her limits, she will reveal her true form, the mere sight of which struck
her husband dead. Adventurers may wish they were so lucky!
%%%%
Blork the orc

A particularly fat and ugly orc. He's scavenged a pair of rainbow-coloured
suspenders from somewhere. They're not helping.
%%%%
Boris

An ancient and powerful lich. Like all true liches, Boris is immortal, and will
regenerate his desiccated skeletal remains even if completely disintegrated.

A violent and wrathful demon, Cerebov appears as a giant humanoid covered in

A withered old gnoll with a long silver beard, wielding a quarterstaff and
wearing a cloak. He looks like a figure from mythology! Wait, is his beard held
on to his ears with hooks?
%%%%
Dispater

The lord of the Iron City of Dis.
%%%%
Dissolution

The Pits of Slime used to be a thriving civilization, and Dissolution was the
prophet of their god. When the city was overtaken by its current residents,
only Dissolution survived, for he alone turned faithfully to the Slime God.
Dissolution became a tremendous mass of acidic ooze, yet retained his
intelligence. He is filled with hatred for anything that can hold a form.

Dowan

A beautiful but vain deep elf with an aptitude for magic and little else. His
skills are the perfect complement of his twin sister Duvessa's fighting prowess.
In search of more powerful spells, he journeys to the surface with his sister.
%%%%
Duvessa

A plain-looking deep elven fighter who is technically brilliant in many forms of
combat, but over-confident because of it. She is complemented by the magical
skills of her twin brother, Dowan. She journeys to the surface to challenge
its greatest champions.
%%%%
Edmund

A jealous sibling of Sigmund (indeed, the youngest of nine brothers). He has
none of Sigmund's skills in magic, but makes up for it with his skills in
fighting and a canny head for money. He is eager to prove his superiority by
killing hapless adventurers with his expensive flail and quick wit.

grimly to himself as he stalks the dungeon, trailing ice crystals through the
air behind him.
%%%%
Frances

A stout warrior who once bested a powerful lord of Pandemonium in combat,
gaining control over the demon's realm and thanes. The battle left her with a
deep facial scar, one that she carries as a badge of honour rather than a
symbol of shame.
%%%%
Frederick

A svelte fighter-mage with a gold-rimmed monocle, a keen sense of tradition,
and the blood of the gods running through his veins. He's here looking for a
worthy opponent, but he's yet to find one.
%%%%
Gastronok

A voracious and surprisingly intelligent slug, devoted to eating everything and
everyone he comes across, with a pointed hat perched rakishly atop his head. He
acquired the hat the same way he acquired his intelligence and his knowledge of
spells: by consuming their former owner, a powerful wizard.

say that his silver horn can summon terrible beasts to aid him in battle.

A middle-aged bounty hunter, anxious to retire after one final job. He hopes to
settle down somewhere and live a quiet life with his family, using the money
from his final bounty: you.
%%%%
Ignacio

While a mortal cannot turn into a demon aside from divine intervention, this is
what happened to Ignacio after Makhleb saw his love for his job and smiled upon
him. He is now slated to continue the joy of his life for all eternity.

Although his new form includes a number of large razor-sharp blades growing
from his demonic appendages, he kept his favourite axe and is eager to let you
test its edge.
%%%%
Ijyb

A small and twisted goblin, wearing some ugly blue rags. She claims dominion
over this level of the dungeon; the punishment for trespassing is death.

Jorgrun

A dwarven magician, particularly well-attuned to the dungeon around him. He
wields powerful earth magic in combat.

%%%%
Josephine

A formidable necromancer, committed to her craft even after it left her aged,
decaying, and half-undead herself.

ago, but he sees no reason why that should stop him.
%%%%
Kirke

A master of transformation and treachery. Beware, or you may be the next swine
to join her herd!
%%%%
the Lernaean hydra

A huge beast, mightiest of hydras, infamous in myth and legend. It flows
through the water faster than a human can run, swatting aside trees as though
they were matchsticks. Its many heads slaver and gnash constantly as it hunts
for prey to slake its bottomless appetite.
%%%%
Lom Lobon

Stoic and inscrutable, Lom Lobon is an ancient demon infamous for its mastery
of magic. Rumoured to be the most learned being in the halls of Pandemonium,
it is at times sought out by mortal wizards who offer their souls in exchange
for the secrets of the arcane. Lacking the terrible wrath present in most
demons, Lom Lobon's single eye instead hides a cold, impartial cruelty.
%%%%
Louise

A mighty sorceress, clad from head to toe in heavy armour. Once an adventurer
looking for the fabled Orb of Zot, she was cast into the Abyss and got
hopelessly lost there. Toyed with by some greater power, she was stuck on the
hostile plane for nearly a decade. When she finally emerged from the Abyss,
Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now
wanders the halls of the dungeon, seeking other adventurers to share her fate.
%%%%

This tall and powerful demon is Mara, Lord of Illusions, mighty among dreamers.
He is capable of creating intricately detailed illusions, so real that they are
almost as deadly as the creatures they impersonate.
%%%%
Margery

A lithe spellcaster in service to the powers of Hell; it is her duty to ensure
that the inhabitants of the Dungeon never forget their place. She personally
slew the ancient dragon from whose hide her strange armour is crafted.
%%%%
Maurice

A sly, conniving thief. In his profession, Maurice is considered a legend — at
least according to himself. He is skilled, nonetheless, and among all the
thieves and rogues lured by the Orb, Maurice is undoubtedly the most crafty.
%%%%
Menkaure

A fair and noble ruler of an ancient and mighty kingdom, mummified after an
early death. His faithful priests subsequently infused him with great and
powerful magic, seeking to grant him eternal life. Now he is forgotten and
reduced to mouldering bandages and dry, brittle bones.
%%%%
Mennas

There was once a human priest named Mennas. He travelled far and wide preaching
of Zin to any who would listen, going even so far as to travel into Orcish
lands, preaching to orcs about laws and mercy. By all accounts the orcs were
not happy with Mennas. They demanded he swear Beogh was the one true god, and
when Mennas remained silent they cut out his tongue.

Whether or not this angel is that same Mennas is something of a mystery, as he
seems to have difficulty speaking.
%%%%
Mnoleg

A weirdly glowing figure, dancing through the twisted air of Pandemonium.
%%%%
Murray

A demonic skull rolling along the ground.
%%%%
Natasha

A magical cat. Once a powerful wizard's familiar, Natasha was abandoned after
her master was consumed by the very necromantic forces he sought to control.
Now she patrols the dungeon, taking a bloody vengeance with spell and claw upon
any adventurer who crosses her path.

This cat doesn't have nine lives, but just one death isn't going to be enough
to put her down for good.
%%%%
Nellie

A highly intelligent elephant who travelled as part of a circus. One dark
night, she slipped out of her chain and disappeared into Pandemonium, never to
be seen again.

Nergalle

A withered sorceress, exceptionally cruel even by orc standards. The living
fear her; the dead obey her every command. She has a soft spot for the latter.
%%%%
Nessos

A centaur warrior, skilled at warfare and deceit. He slew a mighty hydra, and
now its deadly blood drips, still-fuming, from his arrows.

Nikola

A brilliant scientist obsessed with electricity. In his attempts to perfect his
electric golem, he was involved in a terrible accident, and now phases in and
out of reality.
%%%%
Pikel

While kobolds are normally slaves, Pikel's rough life, selfish ambition and
large stature have caused him to rise up and become a slaver himself. He is on
his way to the Orcish Mines to sell his wares, a selection of timid humans who
cower with every crack of his whip.
%%%%
Polyphemus

A cyclops shepherd, he is very protective of his charges, whom he watches with
an undying fervor through his single massive eye. Nevertheless, he won't
hesitate to use them as projectiles in a pinch; after all, the best defence is
a good offence.

%%%%

after a catastrophic spell failure. She is clutching a book.

saw in the dungeon to drive him mad, but his shrewd magical tactics and wicked
scythe now leave little time for his victims to wonder. Despite his reputation
as a vicious murderer, his grandiose and dramatic ways have earned him the
admiration of many denizens of the dungeon.
%%%%
Snorg

A particularly corpulent troll with a short temper and a sizable gut.
Uninterested in the Orb, Snorg delights in the endless parade of adventurers –
that is, easy meals — it attracts.
%%%%

Queen of the tengu, with legendary skill in swordsmanship, tactics, and magic.
%%%%
Sonja

A graceful kobold assassin. Admire her graceful pirouettes, thrill at her
daring leaps! But watch out for her knives!

draconian warrior. Her scales seem to shimmer and change colour as you watch.
%%%%
