# Uniques
Agnes

This spriggan is aged and weathered from years of travel away from the forests
and swamps that are home to her kin. Her choice of weapon and astonishing speed
both speak to the training she underwent. Underestimate her at your peril!
%%%%
Aizul

Once the primary guardian serpent of a legendary treasure hoard, she was
disgraced after thieves looted it while she slept. She seeks to make up for her
failure by protecting the only treasure the villains overlooked, a single
precious talisman.
%%%%
Amaemon

Amaemon always knew he was different, but it was still a horrific surprise when
his demonic heritage manifested. As his body twisted, Amaemon was forced to flee
far from the surface. The passage of time has only left him more obsessed with
what he has lost - consumed by poison both physical and spiritual.
%%%%
Antaeus

Once a hero among the titans, Antaeus grew jealous of the titan queen. In
single combat he challenged and slew her, and for this crime he was exiled and
descended into the Hells. Finding the inhabitants of that place no match for his
might, Antaeus tore from its substance a fourth Hell, Cocytus, a realm born of
frozen spite.
%%%%
Arachne

Once a talented human weaver, Arachne was transformed into a monstrous
half-spider by a jealous rival's curse. Driven out of her village, she found
sanctuary for a time among the jorogumo before a bitter feud forced her to
flee once more.

Now she wanders other corners of the dungeon with a small retinue of loyal
students in tow, seeking a new domain in which they can spin their peerless
tapestries in peace.
%%%%
Asmodeus

Greatest and most cunning of the Lords of Hell, Asmodeus was born when the twin
fires of greed and treachery first sparked to life within a mortal's heart.
His hideous body is perpetually wreathed in flame.
%%%%
Asterion

Once a king infamous for waging bloodthirsty campaigns, Asterion was exiled to
the depths of the dungeon for his crimes. Here he lurks in his tattered finery,
dreaming of a new kingdom. In his lust for power, the minotaur king turned to
the worship of Makhleb, and Makhleb has rewarded him with horrifying
destructive might.
%%%%
Azrael

A powerful, belligerent efreet. (Is there any other kind?)
%%%%
Bai Suzhen

A weary draconian with foreign and watery scales. She has come to the Dungeon
in hopes of resurrecting her mortal husband; a noble cause, for a being once
known for quarrelling with saints and flooding unfortunate temples. If pressed
to her limits, she will reveal her true form, the mere sight of which struck
her husband dead. Adventurers may wish they were so lucky!
%%%%
Blorkula the Orcula

Once a gangly and bedraggled vampire with a strange obsession with colour,
Blorkula was offered succour by a missionary of Beogh and became a portly and
vigorous orc with a strange obsession with colour instead.

He wields magic tinged with every hue of the rainbow, and has mastered the art
of dividing his own form among its many colours to avoid killing blows - though
even he must rest a while before doing so a second time.
%%%%
Boris

An ancient and powerful lich. Like all true liches, Boris is immortal, and will
regenerate his desiccated skeletal remains even if completely disintegrated.
The same cannot be said for his many victims over his many centuries, from
which he collects and channels their dying woes and regrets.
%%%%
Cerebov

A violent and wrathful demon, Cerebov appears as a giant humanoid covered in
shining golden armour and wielding a huge twisted sword.
%%%%
Chuck

Chuck the stone giant loves rocks, the bigger the better! Over the years, he
has managed to amass quite the collection, including some rare, enchanted ones.
%%%%
Crazy Yiuf

A withered old gnoll with a long silver beard, wielding a quarterstaff and
wearing a cloak. He looks like a figure from mythology! Wait, is his beard held
on to his ears with hooks?
%%%%
Dispater

Greatest and most ruthless of the Lords of Hell, Dispater was born when first an
iron sword drank mortal blood. They despise mortal vanities, the pursuit of
‘reason’ and ‘beauty’ - the only art they enjoy is the art of war.
%%%%
Dissolution

The Pits of Slime used to be a thriving civilisation, and Dissolution was the
prophet of their god. When the city was overtaken by its current residents,
only Dissolution survived, for they alone turned faithfully to the Slime God.
Dissolution became a tremendous mass of acidic ooze, yet retained their
intelligence. They are filled with hatred for anything that can hold a form.

%%%%
Dowan

A beautiful but vain deep elf with an aptitude for magic and little else. His
skills are the perfect complement of his twin sister Duvessa's fighting prowess.
In search of more powerful spells, he journeys to the surface with his sister.
%%%%
Duvessa

A plain-looking deep elven fighter who is technically brilliant in many forms of
combat, but over-confident because of it. She is complemented by the magical
skills of her twin brother, Dowan. She journeys to the surface to challenge
its greatest champions.
%%%%
Edmund

A jealous sibling of Sigmund (indeed, the youngest of nine brothers). He has
none of Sigmund's skills in magic, but makes up for it with his skills in
fighting and a canny head for money. He is eager to prove his superiority by
killing hapless adventurers with his expensive flail and quick wit.
%%%%
the Enchantress

First and most fearful of her kind, the Enchantress rules over the spriggans of
the dungeon. She wears an opalescent outfit made of dragon skin that shimmers
with many colours.
%%%%
Ereshkigal

Greatest and most inexorable of the Lords of Hell, Ereshkigal was born when
first a mortal breathed her last. Noiselessly she laughs at lives cut short and
loved ones separated by untimely death, enwreathed in the silence of the grave.
%%%%
Erica

A wild-tempered adventuress. She's quite prideful for an octopode, and brandishes
their venomous capacity and camouflage talents with cruel force.
%%%%
Erolcha

An especially cunning ogre-mage.
%%%%
Eustachio

An apprentice summoner with a flowing moustache. He has funny ideas about
honour.
%%%%
Fannar

A cold-hearted elven sorcerer, draped in robes of high office. They whisper
grimly to themself as they stalk the dungeon, trailing ice crystals through the
air behind them.
%%%%
Frances

A stout warrior who once bested a powerful lord of Pandemonium in combat,
gaining control over the demon's realm and thanes. The battle left her with a
deep facial scar, one that she carries as a badge of honour rather than a
symbol of shame.
%%%%
Frederick

A svelte fighter-mage with a gold-rimmed monocle, a keen sense of tradition,
and the blood of the gods running through his veins. He's here looking for a
worthy opponent, but he's yet to find one.
%%%%
Gastronok

A voracious and surprisingly intelligent slug, devoted to eating everything and
everyone he comes across, with a pointed hat perched rakishly atop his head. He
acquired the hat the same way he acquired his intelligence and his knowledge of
spells: by consuming their former owner, a powerful wizard.
%%%%
Geryon

A huge, three-headed, winged arch-demon, guardian of the four Hells. Legends
say that his silver horn can summon terrible beasts to aid him in battle.
%%%%
Gloorx Vloq

A shadowy figure clothed in profound darkness.
%%%%
Grinder

An inefficient shadow imp previously employed as a torturer in one of the lower
circles of Hell. She has a tendency to complain and make inane statements.
%%%%
Grum

A tough-looking gnoll, wearing the pelt of one of his former war dogs.
%%%%
Grunn

A brutally twisted undead gnoll in the eternal service of Ereshkigal, lord of
Tartarus. Legend has it that he sold his soul to return his most beloved hunting
dog to life. Whether that hound is a member of his current pack, none can say.
%%%%
Harold

A middle-aged bounty hunter, anxious to retire after one final job. He hopes to
settle down somewhere and live a quiet life with his family, using the money
from his final bounty: you.
%%%%
Ignacio

While a mortal cannot turn into a demon aside from divine intervention, this is
what happened to Ignacio after Makhleb saw his love for his job and smiled upon
him. He is now slated to continue the joy of his life for all eternity.

Although his new form includes a number of large razor-sharp blades growing
from his demonic appendages, he kept his favourite axe and is eager to let you
test its edge.
%%%%
Ijyb

A small and shrewd goblin inventor, cast out from her Coglin kin after
accidentally exploding her own exoskeleton and half of the surrounding mountain.
She claims dominion over this level of the dungeon; trespassers will find
themselves on the business end of a homemade wand.
%%%%
Ilsuiw

A deadly merfolk water-witch, who uses her dominion over the tides to draw
unwitting adventurers to their deaths.
%%%%
Jeremiah

Jeremiah was a peaceful dreamer, prone to impromptu naps. They slipped into
slumber while gazing into a magical orb, and dreamed of an old and hateful
power binding them into service. Now Jeremiah stumbles through the dungeon,
searching for the precious dreamshard that will restore their master’s power,
unsure whether they wake or slumber still. Their dreams leak into reality in
the form of a constant stream of butterflies.
%%%%
Jessica

An evil apprentice sorceress. She entered the dungeon hoping to find a quiet,
secluded place where she could study the darker arts without being disturbed.
%%%%
Jorgrun

A dwarven magician, particularly well-attuned to the dungeon around him. He
wields powerful earth magic in combat.
%%%%
Jory

Once a simple village peasant, Jory found himself transformed in undeath into a
powerful creature. Through the countless centuries unlived since then, he has
honed his skills in combat and magic, and amassed great wealth and many
possessions.
%%%%
Joseph

Looks like a mercenary in a stupid-looking hat.
%%%%
Josephina

A fearsome necromancer who followed her craft beyond the limits of flesh and
life. Her pursuit of demonic knowledge left her body ruined, but the powers she
gained allowed her to rebuild her missing limbs from glittering ice.
%%%%
Josephine

A formidable necromancer, committed to her craft even after it left her aged,
decaying, and half-undead herself.
%%%%
Khufu

An incredibly powerful emperor on the way to godhood. He died quite some time
ago, but he sees no reason why that should stop him.
%%%%
Kirke

A master of transformation and treachery. Beware, or you may be the next swine
to join her herd!
%%%%
the Lernaean hydra

A huge beast, mightiest of hydras, infamous in myth and legend. It flows
through the water faster than a human can run, swatting aside trees as though
they were matchsticks. Its many heads slaver and gnash constantly as it hunts
for prey to slake its bottomless appetite.
%%%%
Lodul

An ogre emissary of the Ironbound Order, sent to find and stop intruders before
they enter the Vaults. Fiercely charismatic, he's rallied a small army of his
kin, overawing them with the long-range lightning array he wears on his back.
(The large coin purse he took from the Vaults is also quite persuasive.)
%%%%
Lom Lobon

Stoic and inscrutable, Lom Lobon is an ancient demon infamous for their mastery
of magic. Rumoured to be the most learned being in the halls of Pandemonium,
they are at times sought out by mortal wizards who offer their souls in
exchange for the secrets of the arcane. Lacking the terrible wrath present in
most demons, Lom Lobon's single eye instead hides a cold, impartial cruelty.
%%%%
Louise

A mighty sorceress, clad from head to toe in heavy armour. Once an adventurer
looking for the fabled Orb of Zot, she was cast into the Abyss and got
hopelessly lost there. Toyed with by some greater power, she was stuck on the
hostile plane for nearly a decade. When she finally emerged from the Abyss,
Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now
wanders the halls of the dungeon, seeking other adventurers to share her fate.
%%%%
Mara

This tall and powerful demon is Mara, Lord of Illusions, mighty among dreamers.
He is capable of creating intricately detailed illusions, so real that they are
almost as deadly as the creatures they impersonate.
%%%%
Maggie

In a distant time, Maggie was apprenticed to the dreaded Hell Knights - but she
grew impatient. In search of a shortcut to fame and fortune (and somewhat short
on imagination), she entered the Dungeon and set out to slay a dragon. Now
having slain one, Maggie sees no reason to stop.
%%%%
Margery

A lithe spellcaster in service to the powers of Hell; it is her duty to ensure
that the inhabitants of the Dungeon never forget their place. She personally
slew the ancient dragon from whose hide her strange armour is crafted.
%%%%
Maurice

A sly, conniving thief. A self-proclaimed legend, he was one of the most skilled
and crafty of the thieves and rogues lured by the Orb. The magical parasitic
vines that have claimed his body still wish to continue his life's work, with a
back-up plan of both a vicious magic-drinking maw and potent wands.
%%%%
Menkaure

A fair and noble ruler of an ancient and mighty kingdom, mummified after an
early death. His faithful priests subsequently infused him with great and
powerful magic, seeking to grant him eternal life. Now he is forgotten and
reduced to mouldering bandages and dry, brittle bones.
%%%%
Mennas

There was once a human priest named Mennas. He travelled far and wide as a
missionary of Zin, often venturing even into Orcish lands. He beseeched the orcs
to abandon their false tribes and return to the peoples of their birth; only
Zin's light could truly cleanse the weight of sin that had twisted their bodies.

By all accounts the orcs were not happy with Mennas. Eventually, a group of them
demanded he recant his words and when Mennas remained silent, they cut out his
tongue.

Whether or not this angel is that same Mennas is something of a mystery, as he
seems to have difficulty speaking.
%%%%
Mlioglotl

A demon prince once possessed a hunger for power that was exceptional even by
the standards of his kind. He betrayed his realm to Lugonu, and his reward was
to become this twisted mass of corruption, now known only as Mlioglotl.
%%%%
Mnoleg

A weirdly glowing figure, dancing through the twisted air of Pandemonium.
%%%%
Murray

A demonic skull rolling along the ground.
%%%%
Natasha

A fast-moving magical cat. Once a powerful wizard's familiar, Natasha was
abandoned after her master was consumed by the very necromantic forces he sought
to control. Now she patrols the dungeon, taking a bloody vengeance with spell
and claw upon any adventurer who crosses her path.

This cat doesn't have nine lives, but just one death isn't going to be enough
to put her down for good.
%%%%
Nellie

A highly intelligent elephant who travelled as part of a circus. One dark
night, she slipped out of her chain and disappeared into Pandemonium, never to
be seen again.
%%%%
Nergalle

A shrewd and wizened orc who has devoted her life to chronicling the bloody
history of her people. She claims to know the names and deeds of every last orc
who lost their life in their great exodus into the Dungeon, and even if this is
a lie, she nonetheless seems to be on a first-name basis with many of them.

More than any other orc still breathing, she knows the blood and sacrifice it
took to make this place a refuge for her kind. She will not brook it being
intruded upon by anyone - least of all you.
%%%%
Nessos

A centaur warrior, skilled at warfare and deceit. They slew a mighty hydra, and
now its deadly blood drips, still-fuming, from their arrows.
%%%%
Nikola

A brilliant scientist obsessed with electricity. In his attempts to perfect his
electric golem, he was involved in a terrible accident, and now phases in and
out of reality.
%%%%
Norris

A relaxed water cultist with a healthy tan and a soothing voice. He
doesn't really care if it is you or he who dies — “both” would probably be the
best option.
%%%%
Pargi

An unusually weak troll.
%%%%
Parghit

An unusually strong troll, his thick frame scarred by many against-the-odds
victories. He has been wounded so many times that his body has adapted, and now
heals almost instantly. His necklace of troll claws is a memento of those who
underestimated him.
%%%%
Pikel

A wise kobold would fear the forces of Hell, and certainly would not set up a
highly lucrative transdimensional trade in damned souls. But Pikel is better
known for his whip than his wisdom, mercilessly tormenting his piteous charges
as he ferries them to their buyers.
%%%%
Polyphemus

A cyclops shepherd, he is very protective of his charges, whom he watches with
an undying fervor through his single massive eye. Nevertheless, he won't
hesitate to use them as projectiles in a pinch; after all, the best defence is
a good offence.
%%%%
Prince Ribbit

A frog of unusual size, with a tiny crown perched incongruously atop his head.
%%%%
Psyche

A fair-haired mage, wandering and seemingly half-mad with grief and guilt.
%%%%
Robin

A mountain hobgoblin, recently come in search of the legendary Orb. Not
foolhardy or reckless enough to delve into the depths of the Dungeon alone,
Robin has built a small army of minions. Potential competitors will quickly
find a stream of screaming goblins flying toward them!
%%%%
Roxanne

A strikingly realistic sapphire statue of a famous earth mage who disappeared
after a catastrophic mishap with a magical talisman.
%%%%
Rupert

Rippling muscles, glistening pecs, incredible glutes - Rupert is the peak of
physical perfection. Even so, his roars seem louder than even his fantastic form
can explain. Perhaps he holds some talisman that lends supernatural force to his
bellows?
%%%%
Saint Roka

A mighty warlord. Some orcs even say they are the Chosen One of Beogh.
%%%%
Sigmund

The elder of a pair of brothers who came for the Orb. No one knows what Sigmund
saw in the dungeon to drive him mad, but his shrewd magical tactics and wicked
scythe now leave little time for his victims to wonder. Despite his reputation
as a vicious murderer, his grandiose and dramatic ways have earned him the
admiration of many denizens of the dungeon.
%%%%
Snorg

A particularly corpulent troll with a short temper and a sizable gut.
Uninterested in the Orb, Snorg delights in the endless parade of adventurers –
that is, easy meals — it attracts.
%%%%
Sojobo

Queen of the tengu, with legendary skill in swordsmanship, tactics, and magic.
Storytellers claim she once trapped a raging tempest in a bottle and kept it
as a talisman.
%%%%
Sonja

A graceful kobold assassin. Admire her graceful pirouettes, thrill at her
daring leaps! But watch out for her knives!
%%%%
Terence

A veteran of a war against the armataurs' elephant-riders. He has recently
retired to make a new home in the dungeon.
%%%%
Tiamat

The earthly avatar of Tiamat, deity of dragonkind, here incarnated as a mighty
draconian warrior. Her scales seem to shimmer and change colour as you watch.
%%%%
Urug

A coarse and lanky orc. Urug lost her eye in a fight with a harpy, and has
sworn to slay every last one of them. Unfortunately, the vision in her
remaining eye is not very good, and she has mistaken you for one.
{{

%%%%
Wiglaf

A cantankerous dwarf wearing a stupid-looking hat. He eyes you sourly, as if
deciding exactly how much offence he should take to the way you're staring at
it.
%%%%
Vashnia

An elite marksnaga who leads a skilled team of sharpshooters. She is
particularly skilled in translocation magic.
%%%%
Vv

One of the Stoneborn, formed untold aeons ago with supreme command over rock.
Her people shelter deep within the living earth, so whatever has forced Vv
into the oppressive openness of the Dungeon must be dire indeed. But whatever
it is, she's not talking...
%%%%
Xak'krixis

It has been centuries since outsiders were last allowed access to the cavernous
libraries of the formicids, but their emissaries are still seen from time to
time - surveying other lands for resources or scientific discoveries that might
aid the colony.

This one's study of the magical fibres excreted by orb spiders has already led
to an alchemical breakthrough, allowing them to shape fulminant prisms such that
their explosions are directed at enemies alone. Alas, their enthusiasm to
conduct a field test bodes poorly for your health.
%%%%
Xtahua

An ancient and mighty dragon.
%%%%
Zenata

A master weaponsmith, her flesh melding into steel so smoothly that it's hard to
tell where one ends and the other begins. She entered the Dungeon to search for
the secrets of an ancient, long-suppressed cult, said to have exalted metal over
flesh. The price of knowledge was her humanity - a price she paid eagerly.
%%%%
the Serpent of Hell gehenna

A huge, red-glowing, three-headed dragon, shrouded in damnation. It is
possessed by the very essence of Gehenna and its eternal fire.
%%%%
the Serpent of Hell cocytus

A massive white three-headed dragon, covered with shards of gleaming ice,
wholly possessed by the nightmarish cold of Cocytus.
%%%%
the Serpent of Hell dis

A towering three-headed beast with an army's worth of swords for teeth. Each of
its scales is a shield with a razored edge.
%%%%
the Serpent of Hell tartarus

Seemingly three pairs of lurid magenta eyes hanging in the darkness, the
outline of a vast, sinuous dragon is just barely perceptible behind. Its malice
is palpable.

corrosive slime.

%%%%
alligator snapping turtle

A particularly large and nasty snapping turtle. Like its smaller relative, it
can reach out and bite from afar.
%%%%
anaconda

A very large snake that moves with startling swiftness. It kills not by poison
but by constricting its prey.
%%%%
ancestor

A humanoid construct of insubstantial memory, floating through the air. Though
perhaps somewhat changed in shape and bearing few discernable features, still
they seem somehow to resemble a warrior from the distantly remembered past.
The memory and the memorialist fight in concert, each able to fire past the
other.
%%%%
ancient champion

An unfathomably ancient skeleton. It has hundreds of golden sigils etched onto
its bones, and pulses with terrible, unholy power.
%%%%
ancient lich

A lich who, having existed for countless centuries, has grown almost
unimaginably powerful through the study of dark magic.
%%%%
ancient zyme

A nexus of sentient cancer and disease, borne aloft perhaps by malice alone.
Its nature inflicts withering illness on all living beings in its presence.
%%%%
angel

A divine warrior of the Shining One. It is a towering winged figure of
unnatural beauty surrounded by an aura of brilliant white light.
%%%%
animated armour

The sweat and toil of the armourer working leather and steel infuses a spirit
into their creation, a unique spark within every cuirass, pauldron and vambrace.
A skilled wizard can draw those sparks together, allowing their armour to
protect its wearer in a more aggressive fashion than armour customarily does.
%%%%
apis

A placid, sacred bull of Elyvilon.
%%%%
apocalypse crab

An opalescent crab with jet black eyes, and chaotic mists effusing from its
mandibles. Rumours claim that this species is waiting for the end of time.
%%%%
arcanist

A wizard fond of spectacle and destruction. They scorn the cowardice of other
magicians, who hide from their foes rather than simply blasting them out of
existence.
%%%%
aspiring flesh

The divided and churning remains of a protean progenitor, striving desperately
for form. Whatever they become, the last of their progenitor's power ensure it
will be stronger and swifter than any such creature found elsewhere in the
dungeon.

air around it.

barachi

An amphibious humanoid with a very ugly attitude.

A small globe of magical energy. Each time its creator casts a destructive
Conjuration, it will launch a magical missile at a random foe.

%%%%
bog body

some unknown magic.
%%%%
boggart

A malevolent and dangerous little sprite. The shadowy illusions it summons may
not be real, but are deadly all the same.
%%%%
bombardier beetle

An unassuming beetle filled with an incredible amount of hypergolic fluid. The
sticky spray it fires is capable of igniting predators and unwary adventurers
alike, though more experienced ones know to keep moving if they wish to avoid
a fiery grave.
%%%%
bone dragon

A mighty undead abomination, pieced together from the broken bones of many
dragons by powerful necromantic magic. Fortunately, whatever organ produces a
dragon's fearsome breath was lost in the process.
%%%%
boulder

A mass of fast-rolling stone, crushing everything in its path.
%%%%
boulder beetle

A grey beetle with an almost impenetrable rocky carapace. When at some distance
from its foe, a boulder beetle is capable of rolling at high speed, attempting

others' intellect as it squirms through unworldly grime.
%%%%

own. They move to allow magic and missiles fired by those friendly to this

burial acolyte

A masked priest in the service of Kikubaaqudgha, well-versed in choral rituals
to both rouse the dead and send them to eternal rest.

bush

A woody plant. It looks dry enough to be easily set on fire, and its foliage is
not very dense, permitting both magic and missiles to pass through unaffected.
However, it is firmly rooted, and requires significant effort to destroy.
%%%%
bullfrog

An unusually aggressive amphibian that pursues its prey with rapid hops.
Its croak is loud and distinctive, but unlike its smaller counterparts above
ground, the dungeon bullfrog is as large as it sounds.

foul body is bloated to the extreme, leaking viscous fluid and the stench of
death. His head is that of a boar with bulging eyes and tusks split in two, his
snout flares and oozes as he snorts and squeals at the sight of you, and his
mouth is a toothless rift which drools pools of blood and vomits forth
disgusting remains. His neck is stretched and lops forward, its skin sagging
downward. His immense gut writhes and distorts as the larvae within await their
repugnant release. His legs are unrecognisable masses of flesh, covered in
protrusions and throbbing boils. Your mind reels at the sight of this hideous
form, and your senses begin to shut down in an attempt to preserve your sanity
as you choke on the oppressive stench.
%%%%
