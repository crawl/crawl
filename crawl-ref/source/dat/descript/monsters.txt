Aizul

Once the primary guardian serpent of a legendary treasure hoard, he was
disgraced after thieves looted it while he slept. He now slithers about the
dungeon, seeking vengeance against all would-be looters. He is an accomplished
spellcaster, but no more deadly in melee combat than others of his kind.

Agnes

This somewhat older looking spriggan carries a bladed staff (almost as large as
she is). The pockets of her threadbare robe bulge with jangling coins. The
coins and lajatang do not seem to slow her, though, as she darts to and fro,
her pockets streaming behind her and trembling as if about to burst.
%%%%
Antaeus

Once a mighty and renowned titan, his arrogance was his undoing. Now he is
corrupt and tainted, a powerful demon who lords over the frozen wastes of
Cocytus. His gigantic body seems as though it would be easily struck by your
attacks; unfortunately, it also seems as though it would remain unscathed by
all but the strongest of them.
%%%%
Antaeus:quote

“That country was then ruled by Antaeus, son of Poseidon, who used to kill
strangers by forcing them to wrestle. Being forced to wrestle with him,
Hercules hugged him, lifted him aloft, broke and killed him; for when he
touched earth so it was that he waxed stronger, wherefore some said that he was
a son of Earth.”

    trans. Sir James George Frazer, 1913.
%%%%
Arachne

Once the best human weaver, Arachne was cursed by being transformed into her
present form: half-human, half-spider. No longer aging, she has the youth and
beauty of a human female, along with the legs and abdomen of a monstrous giant
spider.

Thousands of years old, she has learned magic and quite a few other tricks.
Expect to be ensnared by webs and magic while her pets digest and then drink
you dry.

Asmodeus

One of the arch-demons who dwell in the depths of Hell, wreathed in fire.
%%%%
Asmodeus:quote

“For myself, I have other occupations:  I make absurd matches; I marry
greybeards with minors, masters with servants, girls with small fortunes with
tender lovers who have none. It is I who introduced into this world luxury,
debauchery, games of chance, and chemistry. I am the author of the first
cookery book, the inventor of festivals, of dancing, music, plays, and of the

Dissolution

The Pits of Slime used to be a thriving civilization, and Dissolution was the

A jealous sibling of Sigmund (indeed, the youngest of nine brothers). He has

“When the forces stood in array Edmund proposed to decide their claims by
single combat; but Canute saying that he, a man of small stature, would have

them to divide the realm as their fathers had done.”

Fannar

A cold-hearted elven sorcerer, draped in robes of high office. He whispers
grimly to himself as he stalks the dungeon, trailing ice crystals through the
air behind him.

In ages long past, Fannar's wisdom and precocious talent with frost magic won
him the coveted position of magistrate, placing him in charge of enforcing the
law throughout the Elven Halls. By all accounts, he was once well known for
being benevolent, just, and passionate in keeping the elves free from
corruption and crime, even as those around him began to dabble in necromancy
and demonic magic.

Over the long centuries of his tenure, Fannar's devotion to justice has warped
into paranoia and despotism. Even his closest supporters now whisper that his
magical power has begun to border on the self-destructive. Fannar still tries
to keep the elves from falling to evil, unwilling or unable to notice that he
failed long ago.

Gastronok

the Lernaean hydra

An ancient, outsized serpent-like water beast that possesses numerous heads.
The poets mention more heads than vase-painters can paint, poisonous venom
coming out of its eyes, and that this hydra is a guardian of an entrance to the
Underworld. What of this is true, you do not know.
%%%%
the Lernaean hydra:quote

“The second Labour which he undertook was the slaying of the Lernaian Hydra,
 springing from whose single body were fashioned a hundred necks, each bearing
 the head of a serpent. And when one head was cut off, the place where it was
 severed put forth two others; for this reason it was considered to be
 invincible, and with good reason, since the part of it which was subdued sent
 forth a two-fold assistance in its place. Against a thing so difficult to
 manage as this Herakles devised an ingenious scheme and commanded Iolaos to
 sear with a burning brand the part which had been severed, in order to check
 the flow of the blood.”

Lom Lobon

Stoic and inscrutable, Lom Lobon is an ancient demon infamous for his mastery
of magic. Rumoured to be the most learned being in the halls of Pandemonium, he

the secrets of the arcane. Lacking the terrible wrath present in most demons,
Lom Lobon's single eye instead hides a cold, impartial cruelty.

%%%%
lost soul

The echo of a unmourned soul, flickering in and out of the mortal world. Though
the memories of its living self are long-faded, it is drawn to the moment of
death by some lingering instinct. So powerful is its drive for self and purpose
that it seizes upon the passage of other souls, losing the last vestiges of its
being in the memories of another's life.
%%%%
Louise

A mighty sorceress, clad from head to toe in heavy armour. Once an adventurer
looking for the fabled Orb of Zot, she was cast into the Abyss and got
hopelessly lost there. Toyed with by some greater power, she was stuck on the
hostile plane for nearly a decade. When she finally emerged from the Abyss,
Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now
wanders the halls of the dungeon, seeking other adventurers to share her fate.

Mara

This tall and powerful demon is Mara, Lord of Illusions, mighty among dreamers.
He is capable of creating intricately detailed illusions, able to mislead even
the minds of the mightiest and most brilliant spell-casters.

Mara:quote

“This night the Lord of Illusion passed among you, Mara, mighty among dreamers,
mighty for ill. He did come upon another who may work with the stuff of dreams
in a different way. He did meet with Dharma, who may expel a dreamer from his

deathgod against illusionist? You say their ways are incomprehensible, being
the ways of gods. This is not the answer.”

“He who lives looking for pleasures only,

“'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman leaves
his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the
baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the
school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away
they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming,
knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and
astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the

Mennas

There was once a human priest named Mennas. He travelled far and wide preaching
of Zin to any who would listen, going even so far as to travel into Orcish
lands, preaching to orcs about laws and mercy. By all accounts the orcs were
not happy with Mennas. They demanded he swear Beogh was the one true god, and
when Mennas remained silent they cut out his tongue.

Whether or not this angel is that same Mennas is something of a mystery, as he
seems to have difficulty speaking.

Menkaure

A fair and noble ruler of an ancient and mighty kingdom, mummified after an

 Shall our life-days never be merry, and our labour never be done?’

 But Sinfiotli said: ‘I have looked, and lo, there is death in the cup.’

 And the song, and the tinkling of harp-strings to the roof-tree winded up;
 And Sigmund was dreamy with wine and the wearing of many a year;
 And the noise and the glee of the people as the sound of the wild woods were
 And the blossoming boughs of the Branstock were the wild trees waving about;

 So he said: ‘Well seen, my fosterling; let the lip then strain it out.’”

 They are furious, they devise mischief without resting night and day.
 They prepare for battle, fuming and raging;
 They have joined their forces and are making war.
 Tiamat who formed all things,
 Made in addition weapons invincible; she spawned monster-serpents,
 Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang;
 With poison, instead of blood, she filled their bodies.
 Fierce monster-vipers she clothed with terror,
 With splendor she decked them, she made them of lofty stature.
 Whoever beheld them, terror overcame him,
 Their bodies reared up and none could withstand their attack.”

 Out there jumped a little devil, blue in colour; and before
 I could speak to the new comer (for I never was struck dumber),
 Down upon my empty rummer, straight the little devil bore,
 Right into my empty tumbler straight the little devil bore,
 Squatted, grinned and nothing more.

 There the little imp sat grinning at me while my head went spinning,
 So that had I not sat down I should have fallen upon the floor;
 'Though thy looks be somewhat evil,' said I ”tell me thou blue devil,
 Wherefore holdest though thy revel in the glass that held before
 Much the more agreeable spirit,—mizzle! leave me as before.“
 Then the imp said 'Never-more!'

 Though I felt uncommon funky, still this answer put my monkey
 Up, and at the small blue devil in an undertone I swore.
 Then I said I must be dreaming, although broad awake I'm seeming;
 Doubtless I shall have a screaming morning headache — what a bore:
 Salmon I will eat no more.”

“A BOGGART intruded himself, upon what pretext or by what authority is unknown,
into the house of a quiet, inoffensive, and laborious farmer; and, when once it
had taken possession it disputed the right of domicile with the legal mortal
tenant, in a very unneighbourly and arbitrary manner. In particular, it seemed
to have a great aversion to children. As there is no point on which a parent
feels more acutely than that of the maltreatment of his offspring, the feelings
of the father and more particularly of his good dame, were daily, ay, and
nightly, harrowed up by the malice of this malignant and invisible boggart.”

“So passed he over into the island, taking with him the two brothers of
Anaxius; where he found the forsaken knight attired in his own livery, as black
as sorrow itself could see itself in the blackest glass: his ornaments of the
same hue, but formd into the figures of ravens which seemed to gape for
carrion: only his reins were snakes, which finely wrapping themselves one
within the other, their heads came together to the cheeks and bosses of the
bit, where they might seem to bite at the horse, and the horse, as he champed
the bit, to bite at them, and that the white foam was engendered by the
poisonous fury of the combat. His impresa was a Catoblepta, which so long lies
dead as the moon (whereto it hath so natural a sympathy) wants her light. The

the moon’s light.”

“Once upon a time a great Cabbalist lived in Prague called the Rabbi Löw. He
made a human figure of clay, and left a small aperture in the lesser brain in
which he laid a parchment with the unutterable name of God written on it. The
clod immediately arose and was a man; he performed all the duties of a servant
for his creator, he fetched water, and hewed wood. All through the Jews quarter
he was known as the Golem of the great Rabbi Löw. Every Friday evening the
Rabbi took the parchment out of his head, and he was clay until Sunday morning.
Once the Rabbi forgot this duty, all were in the Synagogue, the Sabbath hymn
was begun, when all the women and children in the assembly started and screamed
out, ‘the Golem! the Golem is destroying everything!’ The Rabbi ordered the
precentor to pause at the end of the prayer: it was yet possible to save all,
but later nought would avail, the whole world would be destroyed. He hastened
home, and saw the Golem already seizing the joists of his house to tear down
the building: he sprang forward, took the parchment out, and dead clay again
lay at his feet.”

ascends to the surface, and when he is at ten to twelve fathoms, the boats had
better move out of his vicinity, as he will shortly thereafter burst up, like a

“When Hesperus, the Evening Star, has shown his lovely face
 Three times, from that day, and the defeated stars fled Phoebus,
 It will be the ancient sacred rites of the Lemuria,
 When we make offerings to the voiceless spirits.
 ...
 When midnight comes, lending silence to sleep,
 And all the dogs and hedgerow birds are quiet,
 He who remembers ancient rites, and fears the gods,
 Rises (no fetters binding his two feet)
 And makes the sign with thumb and closed fingers,
 Lest an insubstantial shade meets him in the silence.
 After cleansing his hands in spring water,
 He turns and first taking some black beans,
 Throws them with averted face: saying, while throwing:
 'With these beans I throw I redeem me and mine.'
 He says this nine times without looking back: the shade
 Is thought to gather the beans, and follow behind, unseen.
 Again he touches water, and sounds the Temesan bronze,
 And asks the spirit to leave his house.
 When nine times he’s cried: 'Ancestral spirit, depart,'
 He looks back, and believes the sacred rite’s fulfilled.”

“Freilich verbürgt uns keine Silbe die Existenz von solcherlei Thieren, wenn
wir uns den Drachen oder Lindwurm als ein Ungeheuer vorstellen, dessen langer
Hals in einen Adler-, Löwen- oder Delphinenkopf endigt; das auf dem breiten
Rücken Greifs- oder Nachisittige trägt; und am vielfach gerollten Schweif einen
Stachel mit Widerhaken hat; Feuer speit; sich in Mädchen verliebt und diese
entführt; bald diese bald jene Gestalt annimmt; auf sauer erworbenen Schatzen
ruht — kurz, als ein Ungeheuer, das alle Eigenschaften besitzt, welche die
Fabel ihm andichtet; dann wäre es Wahnsinn, an Drachen und Lindwürmer glauben
zu wollen. Nehmen wir aber dafür bloß ein furchtbares Ungeheuer überhaupt,
welches nun aus unserem Welttheile vertilgt ist, so hat der Glaube daran nichts
Lächerliches.”

it is like the pictures, are as follow:- The plumage is partly red, partly
golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle.
They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be
credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird,
all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the
body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as
he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent
inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball
is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt,
plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such
is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.”

 Cast all our hands about him manfully;
 And then th' old Forger all his forms began:
 First was a lion with a mighty mane,
 Then next a dragon, a pied panther then,
 A vast boar next, and suddenly did strain
 All into water. Last he was a tree,
 Curl'd all at top, and shot up to the sky.”

 But left him ravish'd, and instructed more

 For we know all things whatsoever were
 In wide Troy labour'd; whatsoever there
 The Grecians and the Trojans both sustain'd
 By those high issues that the Gods ordain'd.
 And whatsoever all the earth can show
 T' inform a knowledge of desert, we know.'”

 And I saw the more the fist pounded the more the mouth laughed. The fist is
pounding and pounding, and the mouth answering.”

A large, fleshy mushroom that wanders slowly around the dungeon. It is both
innately curious and incredibly shy, pursuing the objects of its curiosity only
when out of sight. Noxious spores drift around its cap.

wandering mushroom:quote

“Telimena, wearied with the prolonged wrangling, wanted to go out into the
fresh air, but sought a partner. She took a little basket from the peg.
“Gentlemen, I see that you wish to remain within doors,” she said, wrapping
around her head a red cashmere shawl, “but I am going for mushrooms: follow me
who will!” Under one arm she took the little daughter of the Chamberlain, with
the other she raised her skirt up to her ankles. Thaddeus silently hastened
after her—to seek mushrooms!”
    -Adam Mickiewicz, _Pan Tadeusz_, II. 1834.
     trans. G.R. Noyes, 1917.

swimmer.
%%%%
water nymph

A strikingly beautiful and capricious nature spirit, deeply bonded with the
waters in which she lives. Wherever they flow, so may she, and ponds and rivers
surge and leap at her whim. Beware, for many unwitting adventurers have found
themselves drawn beneath her waters by a simple touch, only for it to become
their final resting place.

wraith

This undead spirit appears as a cloud of black mist surrounding an
insubstantial skeletal form. Its eyes burn bright with unholy malevolence and
hunger for life essence, on which it feeds.
%%%%
wraith:quote

“God, though this life is but a wraith,
 Although we know not what we use,

%%%%
wretched star

A conflux of unearthly light and energy, awash in unnatural colours and strange
forms no normal being was meant to perceive. Merely being near it fills your
body with the disorder of the Abyss.

%%%%
ynoxinul:quote

“He fixed his eyes upon the door, which, slowly opening, disclosed a stranger
of majestic form, but scowling features, who demanded sternly, why he was
summoned? 'I did not summon you,' said the trembling student. 'You did!' said
the stranger, advancing, angrily; 'and the demons are not to be invoked in
vain.' The student could make no reply; and the demon, enraged that one of the
uninitiated should have summoned him out of mere presumption, seized him by the
throat and strangled him.

When Agrippa returned, a few days afterwards, he found his house beset with
devils. Some of them were sitting on the chimneypots, kicking up their legs in
the air; while others were playing at leapfrog, on the very edge of the
parapet. His study was so filled with them that he found it difficult to make
his way to his desk.”
    -Charles Mackay, _Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions_, Vol. III,
     Part I. 1841.
%%%%
zombie

A corpse raised to undeath by necromancy.
%%%%
zombie:quote

“It seemed that while the zombie came from the grave, it was neither a ghost,
nor yet a person who had been raised like Lazarus from the dead. The zombie,
they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and
endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life—it is a dead body which
is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive. People who have the power
to do this go to a fresh grave, dig up the body before it has had time to rot,
galvanize it into movement, and then make of it a servant or slave,
occasionally for the commission of some crime, more often simply as a drudge
around the habitation or the farm, setting it dull heavy tasks, and beating it
like a dumb beast if it slackens.”
    -William Seabrook, _The Magic Island_. 1929.

# Specials
test spawner

(If you see this outside wizmode or the arena, this is a bug.)

Whatever it is, it is capable of spawning countless monsters by casting Shadow
Creatures, and is virtually undestructible itself.

To destroy it, lower the central elevator pillar, then pump rockets into the
hole in its exposed brain when the pillar rises to an appropriate height. You
can add another rocket while jumping down.

Oh wait, wrong game.
%%%%

Thanks to your antennae, you know there is some creature there, although you

# arena sprint final boss
Master Blaster

A mighty old lich, notorious for blasting people with powerful conjurations at
the slightest provocation, or just on a whim.
%%%%
Statue of Wucad Mu

This statue, made of a fine glassy orange crystal, depicts a mystic known as
Wucad Mu, who mastered the matters of the mind. Beware of the statue's powers,
as you have no chance in mental combat against it.
%%%%
air elementalist statue

A delicate statue of a tengu gliding through the air. It looks quite
insubstantial.
%%%%
ancient champion

An unfathomably ancient skeleton. It has hundreds of golden sigils etched onto
its bones, and pulses with terrible, unholy power.
%%%%
antique lich

A lich who has grown expensive over countless years.
%%%%
archer statue

The likeness of a beautiful elven archer, sculpted in finest marble. It holds a
bow aloft, and appears to be magically animated, letting it use the bow to
riddle you with arrows.

Being a statue, it doesn't appear to have a means of salvaging shot arrows or
fletching new ones, but you guess the statue's creators gave it enough of a
supply to kill you before someone comes to replenish the quiver.
%%%%
captured wizard

With wild eyes, the wizard frantically mumbles something and waves his arms,
but is unable to cast a single spell. His tongue has been cut off!
%%%%
charred statue

It looks like this statue has been imbued with fire magic, letting it use
fire-based conjurations against you. Fortunately, it looks pretty ineptly made,
and its charring shows that it has trouble controlling its magic as well.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Monster

This terrifying creation looks to have been constructed from the body parts of
every monstrous creature imaginable.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Monster:quote

“I beheld the wretch — the miserable monster whom I had
 created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if
 eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened,
 and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin
 wrinkled his cheeks.”
    -Mary Shelley, “Frankenstein”

# Crawl's felids being sentient, it'd be hard to not make a connection with

conjurer statue

This statue seems to harness the mightiest pure conjurations ever devised by
Iskenderun. It is not made in her likeness, as legends describe her as a female
felid, but, if I were you, I'd pay more heed to the orbs of magic flying your
way than the statue's appearance.
%%%%
crystal guardian

This crystal golem is so ensorcelled that it is immune to nearly any magic
itself, and it can also shoot powerful beams of fire and cold at any
tresspassers.
%%%%
decayed bog body

An undead figure preserved by the brackish waters of a bog. This one seems to
have decayed quite a bit, and looks weak.
%%%%
deep troll monk

It seems a flimsy representation of a monk; nothing more than a half-formed
memory.
%%%%
deformed humanoid

This poor creature looks hideously deformed.
%%%%
demonic plant

Just as demons are shaped in a mockery of living beings, this... thing... here
is a mockery of a plant. The colours don't match, and normal plants don't have
mysterious appendages and tentacles writhing around. Fortunately, this one
appears to be harmless, but with demons, you can never be sure.
%%%%
drunken dwarf

This short fellow seems to be working as an ale quality tester, and is enjoying
the job a little too much.
%%%%
earth elementalist statue

A plain statue of a dwarf wielding a pickaxe. It looks incredibly heavy.
%%%%
fire elementalist statue

An ornately worked statue of an orc holding a torch aloft, hewn from black
basalt. The air around it seems to shimmer.
%%%%
firespitter statue

A statue of a large humanoid head, roughly cut from greyish gabbro. Its mouth
is blackened with scorch-marks, and there is a faint ember glow in its empty
eyes.
%%%%
flesh golem

An animated mound of misshapen flesh.
%%%%
frost-covered statue

An ineptly made statue of a mage. Its magic keeps leaking, letting you know
what kind of spells you can expect: cold-based ones.
%%%%

kamikaze kobold

This kobold is either mad or a martyr for some obscure kobold faith, being
enchanted to explode in a blaze of fire. You'd better keep your distance!

This statue depicts a savage-looking slave driver with a vicious barbed whip.
It appears to be capable of moving the whip arm. Prepare for a flogging...
%%%%

“To be a slave for a moment
 The body offered up to cruelty

A young woman with a fish tail in place of legs. She looks quite sick, but
still capable of bespelling her audience.

orb of electricity

A massive floating ball. It resembles ball lightning, but looks far more
stable. It definitely lacks some heavy-duty insulation, though.
%%%%
# I'm not sure how widely cosmogonical Norse myths are known to an average
# reader; Crawl's audience tends to be far more educated though, so let's
# hope the concepts of Ginnungagap, Niflheim and Muspelheim are not too
# obscure.
orb of ice

A globe of primordial ice, floating in the air. You don't know whether the
tales about the world's once being a void bracketed by realms of endless fire
and cold are true, but if they are, this orb may be a relic of that ancient
time.

Ordinary ice seems to form on the surface, but it is easy to distinguish from
the perfect ball inside. You'd better stay far away, or you may end up frozen.
%%%%
orb slug

A monstrously big slug who apparently ate a mighty conjurer, or maybe an orb
spider. Or perhaps it's a product of divine experiments, in which case it looks
like Xom's handiwork...
%%%%
petrified plant

Something has turned these ordinary plants into stone. Better not tarry here.
If whatever petrified these plants gets you as well, we'll be stuck with a
statue as ugly as you standing here for ages.
%%%%
phase spider

An otherworldly spider that can move short and medium distances by briefly
shifting between the planes of reality, in order to better ensnare its prey.
%%%%
pristine statue

An immaculately sculpted porphyry statue of an archer poised to release an
arrow, with a full quiver at the hip. The individually sculpted arrows look
almost as if they could be removed one by one and used in a real bow.
%%%%

A young woman with a fish tail in place of legs. She looks quite sick, but
still capable of bespelling her audience.
%%%%

A glistening silver machine.

 hundred feet long and could run on a thimbleful of earth or

    -Sweet Their Blood and Sticky, Albert Teichner
%%%%
succubus

A female demon who uses her charms to seduce humanoid males. If you wish to
take advantage of her, however, you will fail: she seems very angry right now
and has blood more on her mind than fun.
%%%%
water elementalist statue

A smooth, charming statue of a beautiful mermaid bathing in a fountain,
sculpted from creamy, faintly pinkish travertine. It glistens softly in the
light, as if sprinkled in actual water.
%%%%
young spriggan druid

A junior member of the order of spriggans sworn to protect nature. While less
dangerous than the elders, this one is perfectly capable of dealing with
trespassers like you.

{{

%%%%
vine covered stone golem

While made of ordinary old weathered stone, covered with moss and vines, this
golem still needs to be respected. It is still hard as stone, after all, and
its weight spells massive damage if it connects a blow.
%%%%
witch

An old and unnaturally ugly human, wearing robes stained with what appears to
be swamp ooze, cauldron soot and brew ingredients.

A magician with such stellar sanity and manners probably has great pets as
well. You might not have to wait long to find out for certain.
%%%%
witch:quote

“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”
    -KJV Bible, Exodus 22:18
%%%%
withered plant

This plant lost the war against life-draining influences, and yet its physical
form is intact. Its dead body stays here uneaten, as the small creatures that
would naturally decompose it prefer to stay away. And it looks like this plant
died many {{ if you.branch() == "Crypt" or you.branch() == "Tomb" then return
"centuries"; else return "years"; end }} ago.
%%%%
wizard statue

In this land of magic, it'd be foolish to assume that a statue of a wizard is
always an inert piece of rock. This statue's hands and staff have very little
dust compared to the base, suggesting it is capable of making magical gestures.
The trap is too obvious, but dealing with it might not be.
%%%%
zin angel

A divine agent of Zin, it is a towering winged figure with an aura of brilliant
white light. This angel's face, though, is marked by a scowl, as if its zeal
against any real or perceived vice overshadows its goodness.
%%%%
zot statue

An utterly bizarre statue, hewn from a single piece of dark gabbro
scintillating with tiny crystals. It is impossible to tell whether the statue
is intended to represent some creature or personage, or is completely abstract.
One thing is certain: it is profoundly disturbing.

### Meatsprint
bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. It is a
horrendous imitation of the human form, consisting of an unrecognisable mass of
meat stitched together with limbs sewn on seemingly at random. Its skin hangs
off loosely in some places and bulges repulsively in others. Each one bears a
large symbol carved into its flesh, a mark of pride from its twisted creator.
%%%%
large bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its
bloated hulk pulsates and throbs constantly with accursed fires. It looks as if
it could explode into a torrent of viscera at any moment.
%%%%
meat berserker

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its form
is large and muscular. It moves swiftly and with impetuous fury, the sole
thought within its being to rend you apart with great fervour. As it rages, it
creates a cacophonous din.
%%%%
meat hydra

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Each of
its eight necks is distended and elongated, connected to a colossal body
crumpled and dripping with ichor. Its many heads spew blood while writhing and
convulsing in agony, as it brings torment to itself and anything else that
beholds its foul visage.
%%%%
meat beast

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Ablaze
with demonic frenzy, it gores and tramples with ferocity unmatched. Its skin is
flayed, exposing the glistening tendons and sinew underneath, and the teeth
inside its cavernous maw are stained with blood.
%%%%
sculptor of flesh

An artisan of unlife, the sculptor appears as a grim skeletal form. It has six
long arms ending in mangled hands with broken fingers, upon which it crawls
like a spider. Its skull is abnormally large and full of holes. Its bones are
reddened and fractured, inscribed with the unholy spells it weaves to assemble
its puppets.
%%%%
destroyer

The destroyers begin to descend upon you. They come in numbers and with wrath,
maws gaping like abaddon, bottomless and abyssal. They bring your doom and will
feast on your remains.
%%%%
accursed

The accursed are the ones who came before. They have come to ensure you share
their fate.
%%%%
tyrant

A colossal mass of bones and skulls, a walking tomb. You hear shrieks and
screams as it approaches, shattering off bones with each crushing step,
reassembling itself in eternal unrest.
%%%%
dread

An affront to existence, a void in which there is only torment and hellfire.
Its unearthly form is torn and twisted, black and hollow. It is bereft of
rational thought, knowing only hatred and the desire to desecrate your soul.
%%%%
scourge

A vast serpentine form with raw and diseased skin, seeping bile and pus,
spouting venom and blight.
%%%%
observer

You see the unseen, you stare and they stare back. They whisper and laugh, they
grin and cry, they leer at you with contempt and gaze at you in adoration. They
are the observers, they are the judge of your worth and will decide your end.
%%%%
meat lost soul

A spectre, struggling to leave the mortal world it is incarcerated in. It
drains life and unlife from all those it comes into contact with.
%%%%
fleshlord

One of the greatest servants of the Meatlord. It is muscular, agile and full of
malevolence.
%%%%
vile

An emaciated figure brimming with hellfire and plague. Its appearance signifies
the end of days.
%%%%
The Servant

His glaive is alight with the flames of hell.
%%%%
The Captor

Those who enter will not escape.
%%%%
The Defiler

His shield is emblazoned with images of infernal flames.
%%%%
The Meatlord

You behold the embodiment of filth, corruption and depravity, the Meatlord. His
foul body is bloated to the extreme, leaking viscous fluid and the stench of
death. His head is that of a boar with bulging eyes and tusks split in two, his
snout flares and oozes as he snorts and squeals at the sight of you, his mouth
is a toothless rift which drools pools of blood and vomits forth disgusting
remains. His neck is stretched and lops forward, its skin sagging downward. His
immense gut writhes and distorts as the larvae within await their repugnant
release. His legs are unrecognisable masses of flesh, covered in protrusions
and throbbing boils. Your mind reels at the sight of this hideous form and your
senses begin to shut down in an attempt to preserve your sanity as you choke on
the oppressive stench.
%%%%
The Unspeakable

You hear the echoes of planets behind the deafening roar of stars as it
approaches. It is the jaws of the abyss. It brings forth crawling chaos from
within. It is the last sight you will ever see.
%%%%
