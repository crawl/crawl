# Uniques
Aizul

Once the primary guardian serpent of a legendary treasure hoard, he was
disgraced after thieves looted it while he slept. He now slithers about the
dungeon, seeking vengeance against all would-be looters. He is an accomplished
spellcaster, but no more deadly in melee combat than others of his kind.
%%%%
Agnes

This somewhat older looking spriggan carries a bladed staff (almost as large as
she is). The pockets of her threadbare robe bulge with jangling coins. The
coins and lajatang do not seem to slow her, though, as she darts to and fro,
her pockets streaming behind her and trembling as if about to burst.
%%%%
Antaeus

Once a mighty and renowned titan, his arrogance was his undoing. Now he is
corrupt and tainted, a powerful demon who lords over the frozen wastes of
Cocytus. His gigantic body seems as though it would be easily struck by your
attacks; unfortunately, it also seems as though it would remain unscathed by
all but the strongest of them.
%%%%
Arachne

Once the best human weaver, Arachne was cursed by being transformed into her
present form: half-human, half-spider. No longer aging, she has the youth and
beauty of a human female, along with the legs and abdomen of a monstrous giant
spider.

Thousands of years old, she has learned magic and quite a few other tricks.
Expect to be ensnared by webs and magic while her pets digest and then drink
you dry.
%%%%
Asmodeus

One of the arch-demons who dwell in the depths of Hell, wreathed in fire.
%%%%
Azrael

A powerful, belligerent efreet. (Is there any other kind?)
%%%%
Blork the orc

A particularly fat and ugly orc. He seems to have scavenged a pair of
rainbow-coloured suspenders from somewhere. They're not helping.
%%%%
Boris

An ancient and powerful lich. Like all true liches, Boris is immortal, and will
regenerate his desiccated skeletal remains even if completely disintegrated.
%%%%
Cerebov

A violent and wrathful demon, Cerebov appears as a giant human covered in
shining golden armour and wielding a huge twisted sword.
%%%%
Chuck

Chuck the stone giant loves rocks, the bigger the better! Over the years, he
has managed to amass quite the collection, including some rare, enchanted ones.
%%%%
Crazy Yiuf

A withered old gnoll with a long silver beard, wielding a quarterstaff and
wearing a cloak. He looks like a figure from mythology! Wait, is his beard held
on to his ears with hooks?
%%%%
Dispater

The lord of the Iron City of Dis.
%%%%
Dissolution

The Pits of Slime used to be a thriving civilization, and Dissolution was the
prophet of their god. When the city was overtaken by its current residents,
only Dissolution survived, for he alone turned faithfully to the Slime God.
Dissolution became a tremendous mass of acidic ooze, yet retained his
intelligence. He is filled with hatred for anything that can hold a form.

Dowan

A beautiful but vain elf with an aptitude for magic and little else. His skills
are the perfect complement of his twin sister Duvessa's fighting prowess.
%%%%
Duvessa

A plain-looking elven fighter who is technically brilliant in many forms of
combat, but over-confident because of it. She is complemented by the magical
skills of her twin brother, Dowan.
%%%%
Edmund

A jealous sibling of Sigmund (indeed, the youngest of nine brothers). He has
none of Sigmund's skills in magic, but makes up for it with his skills in
fighting and a canny head for money. He is eager to prove his superiority by
killing hapless adventurers with his expensive flail and quick wit.
%%%%
the Enchantress

A beautiful spriggan woman, the ruler of spriggans who live here. She wears an
opalescent outfit made of dragon skin that shimmers with all colours.

The air around her shows hints of many powerful enchantment spells she cast on
herself.

A comely spellweaver.

An apprentice summoner with a flowing moustache. He has funny ideas about
honour.
%%%%
Frances

A stout warrior who once bested a powerful lord of Pandemonium in combat,
gaining control over the demon's realm and thanes. The battle left her with a
deep facial scar, one that she carries as a badge of honour rather than a
symbol of shame.
%%%%
Frederick

A svelte fighter-mage who wears a gold-rimmed monocle and seeks a suitable and
worthy opponent. You likely do not fit the bill.
%%%%
Fannar

A cold-hearted elven sorcerer, draped in robes of high office. He whispers
grimly to himself as he stalks the dungeon, trailing ice crystals through the
air behind him.

In ages long past, Fannar's wisdom and precocious talent with frost magic won
him the coveted position of magistrate, placing him in charge of enforcing the
law throughout the Elven Halls. By all accounts, he was once well known for
being benevolent, just, and passionate in keeping the elves free from
corruption and crime, even as those around him began to dabble in necromancy
and demonic magic.

Over the long centuries of his tenure, Fannar's devotion to justice has warped
into paranoia and despotism. Even his closest supporters now whisper that his
magical power has begun to border on the self-destructive. Fannar still tries
to keep the elves from falling to evil, unwilling or unable to notice that he
failed long ago.
%%%%
Gastronok

A voracious and surprisingly intelligent slug, devoted to eating everything and
everyone he comes across, with a pointed hat perched rakishly atop his head. He
acquired the hat the same way he acquired his intelligence and his knowledge of
spells: by consuming their former owner, a powerful wizard.
%%%%

A huge, three-headed, winged arch-demon, guardian of the four Hells. Legends
say that his silver horn is used to throw open the gates of Hell themselves.

Harold

A middle-aged bounty hunter, anxious to retire from bounty-hunting after one
final job. He hopes to settle down somewhere and live a quiet life with his
family, using the money from his final bounty: you.
%%%%
Ignacio

While a mortal cannot turn into a demon aside from divine intervention, this is
what happened to Ignacio after Makhleb saw his love for his job and smiled upon
him. He is now slated to continue the joy of his life for all eternity.

Although his new form includes a number of large razor-sharp blades growing
from his demonic appendages, he kept his favourite axe and is eager to let you
test its edge.
%%%%
Ijyb

A small and twisted goblin, wearing some ugly blue rags. He claims dominion
over this level of the dungeon; the punishment for trespassing is death.
%%%%
Ilsuiw

A cunning merfolk water-witch, who uses her beauty and spellcraft to draw
unwitting adventurers to their deaths.
%%%%
Jessica

An evil apprentice sorceress. She entered the dungeon hoping to find a quiet,
secluded place where she could study the darker arts without being disturbed.
%%%%
Jorgrun

A deep dwarven magician, particularly well-attuned to the dungeon around him.
He wields powerful earth magic in combat.
%%%%
Jory

Once a simple village peasant, Jory found himself transformed in undeath into a
powerful creature. Through the countless centuries unlived since then, he has
honed his skills in combat and magic, amassed great wealth and many
possessions.
%%%%
Joseph

Looks like a mercenary.
%%%%
Josephine

A hideous crone, her face covered in warts, moles and the occasional patch of
hair, Josephine's appearance may fool one into thinking she is some weak old
woman, but she is truly a formidable necromancer. The use of black magic has
taken a physical toll on and prematurely aged Josephine, turning the once
beautiful lady into an ugly hag.
%%%%
Khufu

An incredibly powerful emperor on the way to godhood.
%%%%
Kirke

A beautiful enchantress.
%%%%
the Lernaean hydra

An ancient, outsized serpent-like water beast that possesses numerous heads.
The poets mention more heads than vase-painters can paint, poisonous venom
coming out of its eyes, and that this hydra is a guardian of an entrance to the
Underworld. What of this is true, you do not know.
%%%%
Lom Lobon

Stoic and inscrutable, Lom Lobon is an ancient demon infamous for his mastery
of magic. Rumoured to be the most learned being in the halls of Pandemonium, he
is at times sought out by mortal wizards who offer their souls in exchange for
the secrets of the arcane. Lacking the terrible wrath present in most demons,
Lom Lobon's single eye instead hides a cold, impartial cruelty.
%%%%
lorocyproca

A tall and gaunt figure, draped in long robes which flow as if alive. It
thirsts for magical energies.
%%%%
lost soul

The echo of a unmourned soul, flickering in and out of the mortal world. Though
the memories of its living self are long-faded, it is drawn to the moment of
death by some lingering instinct. So powerful is its drive for self and purpose
that it seizes upon the passage of other souls, losing the last vestiges of its
being in the memories of another's life.
%%%%
Louise

A mighty sorceress, clad from head to toe in heavy armour. Once an adventurer
looking for the fabled Orb of Zot, she was cast into the Abyss and got
hopelessly lost there. Toyed with by some greater power, she was stuck on the
hostile plane for nearly a decade. When she finally emerged from the Abyss,
Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now
wanders the halls of the dungeon, seeking other adventurers to share her fate.
%%%%
Mara

This tall and powerful demon is Mara, Lord of Illusions, mighty among dreamers.
He is capable of creating intricately detailed illusions, so real they can do a
good part of what the creature depicted could.
%%%%
Margery

A lithe spellcaster in service to the powers of Hell; it is her duty to ensure
that the inhabitants of the Dungeon never forget their place. She personally
slew the ancient dragon from whose hide her strange armour is crafted.
%%%%
Maud

A mysterious warrior princess from a far-off kingdom, on a quest to retrieve
the legendary sword ‘Entarex’. Countless have been the admirers who, thinking
about Maud, forgot everything else.
%%%%
Maurice

A sly, conniving thief. In his profession, Maurice is considered a legend — at
least according to himself. He is skilled, nonetheless, and among all the
thieves and rogues lured by the Orb, Maurice is undoubtedly the most crafty.
%%%%
Mennas

There was once a human priest named Mennas. He travelled far and wide preaching
of Zin to any who would listen, going even so far as to travel into Orcish
lands, preaching to orcs about laws and mercy. By all accounts the orcs were
not happy with Mennas. They demanded he swear Beogh was the one true god, and
when Mennas remained silent they cut out his tongue.

Whether or not this angel is that same Mennas is something of a mystery, as he
seems to have difficulty speaking.
%%%%
Menkaure

A fair and noble ruler of an ancient and mighty kingdom, mummified after an
early death. His faithful priests subsequently infused him with great and
powerful magic, seeking to grant him eternal life. Now he is forgotten and
reduced to mouldering bandages and dry, brittle bones.
%%%%
Mnoleg

A weirdly glowing figure, dancing through the twisted air of Pandemonium.
%%%%

%%%%

A brilliant scientist obsessed with electricity. In his attempts to perfect his
electric golem, he was involved in a terrible accident, and now phases in and
out of reality.
%%%%
Norris

A relaxed peace-in-death cultist with a healthy tan and a soothing voice. He
doesn't really care if it is you or him who dies — “both” would probably be the
best option.
%%%%
Pikel

While kobolds are normally slaves, Pikel's rough life, selfish ambition and
large stature have caused him to rise up and become a slaver himself. He is on
his way to the Orcish Mines to sell his wares, a selection of timid humans that
cower with every crack of his whip.
%%%%
Polyphemus

A cyclops shepherd, he is very protective of his charges, whom he watches with
an undying fervor through his single massive eye.
%%%%
Prince Ribbit

A handsome prince before he was cursed, he now adventures for a cure. On the
top of his head he wears a crown tilted jauntily to one side. How it still
stays in place even after his transformation is a mystery.

A fair-haired mage, wandering and seemingly half-mad with grief and guilt.

%%%%
Sigmund

The elder of a pair of brothers who came for the Orb. No one knows what Sigmund
saw in the dungeon to drive him mad, but his shrewd magical tactics and wicked
scythe now leave little time for his victims to wonder. Despite his reputation
as a vicious murderer, his grandiose and dramatic ways have earned him the
admiration of many denizens of the dungeon.
%%%%
Snorg

A particularly corpulent troll with a short temper and a sizable gut.
Uninterested in the Orb, Snorg delights in the endless parade of adventurers –
that is, easy meals — it attracts.

Sonja

A graceful kobold assassin. Admire her graceful pirouettes, thrill at her
daring leaps! But watch out for her knives!
%%%%
Sojobo

King of the tengu, with legendary skill in swordsmanship, tactics, and magic.
%%%%
Terence

A violent murderer who kills for both pleasure and profit, Terence has been
forced into hiding after a botched job, and can't really afford to risk letting
anyone who has seen him leave the dungeon alive — there is a price on his head,
after all.
%%%%
Tiamat

A powerful dragon with mighty wings. Her scales seem to shimmer and change
colour as you watch.
%%%%
Urug

A coarse and lanky orc. Urug lost his eye in a fight with a harpy, and has
sworn to slay every last one of them. Unfortunately, the vision in his
remaining eye is not very good, and he has mistaken you for one.

A huge red glowing dragon, burning with hellfire. It seems to be possessed by
the very essence of Gehenna and its eternal fire.
%%%%
the Serpent of Hell cocytus

You can barely move through the hellish cold that's freezing your soul. It
emanates from this massive white dragon. Your eyes hurt from the temperature,
and from the gleam of shards of ice covering the demonic beast.
%%%%
the Serpent of Hell dis

A towering beast with an army's worth of swords for teeth. Each scale is a
shield with a razored edge. It watches you through a pair of featureless chrome
spheres.
%%%%
the Serpent of Hell tartarus

A pair of lurid magenta eyes hang in the darkness before you. You can just
barely trace the outline of a vast, sinuous dragon. Its malice for you is
palpable.

you!
%%%%
apocalypse crab

An opalescent crab with jet black eyes. A distant relative of the fire crab,

mists effusing from its mandible are hardly suggestive of waiting.

An extremely cold blob of bright blue cytoplasm, forming bits of frost in the
air around it.

baby alligator

A juvenile alligator. While it does not have crushing jaws, nor the strength to

boggarts, to do their perverse bidding. These troublesome pests can also cloud

dragons by powerful necromantic magic. This creature is unique among dragons in
that it lacks a typical dragon's fearsome breath.

bog body

An undead figure preserved by the brackish waters of a bog. Though it has been

decaying.

solid rock.

A sluggish black buffalo, its hide encrusted with dull scales. It carries its

A muscular centaur, a veteran of numerous battles, armed with well-made weapons

claws may be enough to rip hydra heads.

strength of giants and its bark withstand the bite of battleaxes. A curious
buzzing sound seems to follow it as it moves....

This statue seems to harness the mightiest pure conjurations ever devised by

what kind of spells you can expect: cold-based ones.

human monk

It seems a flimsy representation of a monk; nothing more than a half-formed
memory.

It seems a flimsy representation of a monk; nothing more than a half-formed

%%%%
kamikaze kobold

This kobold is either mad or a martyr for some obscure kobold faith, being
enchanted to explode in a blaze of fire. You'd better keep your distance!
%%%%
lasher statue

This statue depicts a savage-looking slave driver with a vicious barbed whip.
It appears to be capable of moving the whip arm. Prepare for a flogging...
%%%%
malarious mermaid

A young woman with a fish tail in place of legs. She looks quite sick, but
still capable of bespelling her audience.
%%%%
# Sprint only, too unhinged for regular games...
oklob plant annihilator

It would seem inconceivable that a mere plant could attain sentience and the
use of magic, but that's what you see here. What sorcery is it?

%%%%
orb of electricity

A massive floating ball. It resembles ball lightning, but looks far more
stable. It definitely lacks some heavy-duty insulation, though.
%%%%
# I'm not sure how widely cosmogonical Norse myths are known to an average
# reader; Crawl's audience tends to be far more educated though, so let's
# hope the concepts of Ginnungagap, Niflheim and Muspelheim are not too
# obscure.
orb of ice

A globe of primordial ice, floating in the air. You don't know whether the
tales about the world's once being a void bracketed by realms of endless fire
and cold are true, but if they are, this orb may be a relic of that ancient
time.

Ordinary ice seems to form on the surface, but it is easy to distinguish from
the perfect ball inside. You'd better stay far away, or you may end up frozen.
%%%%
orb slug

A monstrously big slug who apparently ate a mighty conjurer, or maybe an orb
spider. Or perhaps it's a product of divine experiments, in which case it looks
like Xom's handiwork...
%%%%
petrified plant

Something has turned these ordinary plants into stone. Better not tarry here.
If whatever petrified these plants gets you as well, we'll be stuck with a
statue as ugly as you standing here for ages.
%%%%
phase spider

An otherworldly spider that can move short and medium distances by briefly
shifting between the planes of reality, in order to better ensnare its prey.
%%%%
pristine statue

An immaculately sculpted porphyry statue of an archer poised to release an
arrow, with a full quiver at the hip. The individually sculpted arrows look
almost as if they could be removed one by one and used in a real bow.
%%%%
sickly siren

A young woman with a fish tail in place of legs. She looks quite sick, but
still capable of bespelling her audience.
%%%%
strange machine

A glistening silver machine.
%%%%
succubus

A female demon who uses her charms to seduce humanoid males. If you wish to
take advantage of her, however, you will fail: she seems very angry right now
and has blood more on her mind than fun.
%%%%
water elementalist statue

A smooth, charming statue of a beautiful mermaid bathing in a fountain,
sculpted from creamy, faintly pinkish travertine. It glistens softly in the
light, as if sprinkled in actual water.
%%%%
young spriggan druid

A junior member of the order of spriggans sworn to protect nature. While less
dangerous than the elders, this one is perfectly capable of dealing with
trespassers like you.

{{

%%%%
vine covered stone golem

While made of ordinary old weathered stone, covered with moss and vines, this
golem still needs to be respected. It is still hard as stone, after all, and
its weight spells massive damage if it connects a blow.
%%%%
witch

An old and unnaturally ugly human, wearing robes stained with what appears to
be swamp ooze, cauldron soot and brew ingredients.

A magician with such stellar sanity and manners probably has great pets as
well. You might not have to wait long to find out for certain.
%%%%
withered plant

This plant lost the war against life-draining influences, and yet its physical
form is intact. Its dead body stays here uneaten, as the small creatures that
would naturally decompose it prefer to stay away. And it looks like this plant
died many {{ if you.branch() == "Crypt" or you.branch() == "Tomb" then return
"centuries"; else return "years"; end }} ago.
%%%%
zin angel

A divine agent of Zin, it is a towering winged figure with an aura of brilliant
white light. This angel's face, though, is marked by a scowl, as if its zeal
against any real or perceived vice overshadows its goodness.
%%%%
zot statue

An utterly bizarre statue, hewn from a single piece of dark gabbro
scintillating with tiny crystals. It is impossible to tell whether the statue
is intended to represent some creature or personage, or is completely abstract.
One thing is certain: it is profoundly disturbing.

### Meatsprint
bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. It is a
horrendous imitation of the human form, consisting of an unrecognisable mass of
meat stitched together with limbs sewn on seemingly at random. Its skin hangs
off loosely in some places and bulges repulsively in others. Each one bears a
large symbol carved into its flesh, a mark of pride from its twisted creator.
%%%%
large bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its
bloated hulk pulsates and throbs constantly with accursed fires. It looks as if
it could explode into a torrent of viscera at any moment.
%%%%
meat berserker

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its form
is large and muscular. It moves swiftly and with impetuous fury, the sole
thought within its being to rend you apart with great fervour. As it rages, it
creates a cacophonous din.
%%%%
meat hydra

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Each of
its eight necks is distended and elongated, connected to a colossal body
crumpled and dripping with ichor. Its many heads spew blood while writhing and
convulsing in agony, as it brings torment to itself and anything else that
beholds its foul visage.
%%%%
meat beast

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Ablaze
with demonic frenzy, it gores and tramples with ferocity unmatched. Its skin is
flayed, exposing the glistening tendons and sinew underneath, and the teeth
inside its cavernous maw are stained with blood.
%%%%
sculptor of flesh

An artisan of unlife, the sculptor appears as a grim skeletal form. It has six
long arms ending in mangled hands with broken fingers, upon which it crawls
like a spider. Its skull is abnormally large and full of holes. Its bones are
reddened and fractured, inscribed with the unholy spells it weaves to assemble
its puppets.
%%%%
destroyer

The destroyers begin to descend upon you. They come in numbers and with wrath,
maws gaping like abaddon, bottomless and abyssal. They bring your doom and will
feast on your remains.
%%%%
accursed

The accursed are the ones who came before. They have come to ensure you share
their fate.
%%%%
tyrant

A colossal mass of bones and skulls, a walking tomb. You hear shrieks and
screams as it approaches, shattering off bones with each crushing step,
reassembling itself in eternal unrest.
%%%%
dread

An affront to existence, a void in which there is only torment and hellfire.
Its unearthly form is torn and twisted, black and hollow. It is bereft of
rational thought, knowing only hatred and the desire to desecrate your soul.
%%%%
scourge

A vast serpentine form with raw and diseased skin, seeping bile and pus,
spouting venom and blight.
%%%%
observer

You see the unseen, you stare and they stare back. They whisper and laugh, they
grin and cry, they leer at you with contempt and gaze at you in adoration. They
are the observers, they are the judge of your worth and will decide your end.
%%%%
meat lost soul

A spectre, struggling to leave the mortal world it is incarcerated in. It
drains life and unlife from all those it comes into contact with.
%%%%
fleshlord

One of the greatest servants of the Meatlord. It is muscular, agile and full of
malevolence.
%%%%
vile

An emaciated figure brimming with hellfire and plague. Its appearance signifies
the end of days.
%%%%
The Servant

His glaive is alight with the flames of hell.
%%%%
The Captor

Those who enter will not escape.
%%%%
The Defiler

His shield is emblazoned with images of infernal flames.
%%%%
The Meatlord

You behold the embodiment of filth, corruption and depravity, the Meatlord. His
foul body is bloated to the extreme, leaking viscous fluid and the stench of
death. His head is that of a boar with bulging eyes and tusks split in two, his
snout flares and oozes as he snorts and squeals at the sight of you, his mouth
is a toothless rift which drools pools of blood and vomits forth disgusting
remains. His neck is stretched and lops forward, its skin sagging downward. His
immense gut writhes and distorts as the larvae within await their repugnant
release. His legs are unrecognisable masses of flesh, covered in protrusions
and throbbing boils. Your mind reels at the sight of this hideous form and your
senses begin to shut down in an attempt to preserve your sanity as you choke on
the oppressive stench.
%%%%
The Unspeakable

You hear the echoes of planets behind the deafening roar of stars as it
approaches. It is the jaws of the abyss. It brings forth crawling chaos from
within. It is the last sight you will ever see.
%%%%
