# Uniques
Aizul

Once the primary guardian serpent of a legendary treasure hoard, he was
disgraced after thieves looted it while he slept. He now slithers about the
dungeon, seeking vengeance against all would-be looters. He is an accomplished
spellcaster, but no more deadly in melee combat than others of his kind.
%%%%%
Agnes

A tall (for her kind) and beautiful warrior, as vain as she is quick. You can't
help but notice both her exotic weapon and graceful movements. She searches the
dungeon for aesthetically pleasing objects to surround herself with.
%%%%
Antaeus

Once a mighty and renowned Titan, his arrogance was his undoing. Now he is
corrupt and tainted, a powerful demon who lords over the frozen wastes of
Cocytus. His gigantic body seems as though it would be easily struck by your
attacks; unfortunately, it also seems like it would remain unscathed by all but
the strongest of them.
%%%%
Arachne

Once the best human weaver, Arachne was cursed by being transformed into her
present form: half-human, half-spider. No longer ageing, she has the youth and
beauty of a human female, along with the legs and abdomen of a monstrous giant
spider.

Thousands years old, she has learned magic and quite a few other tricks. Expect
to be ensnared by webs and magic while her pets digest and then drink you dry.
%%%%
Asmodeus

One of the arch-demons who dwell in the depths of Hell, wreathed in fire.
%%%%
Azrael

A powerful, belligerent efreet. (Is there any other kind?)
%%%%
Blork the orc

A particularly fat and ugly orc. He seems to have scavenged a pair of
rainbow-coloured suspenders from somewhere. They're not helping.
%%%%
Boris

An ancient and powerful lich. Like all true liches, Boris is immortal, and will
regenerate his desiccated skeletal remains even if completely disintegrated.
%%%%
Cerebov

A violent and wrathful demon, Cerebov appears as a giant human covered in
shining golden armour and wielding a huge twisted sword.
%%%%
Chuck

Chuck the stone giant loves rocks, the bigger the better! Over the years, he
has managed to amass quite the collection, including some rare, enchanted ones.
%%%%
Crazy Yiuf

A withered old gnoll with a long silver beard, wielding a quarterstaff and
wearing a cloak. He looks like a figure from mythology! Wait, is his beard held
on to his ears with hooks?
%%%%
Dispater

The lord of the Iron City of Dis.
%%%%
Dissolution

The Pits of Slime used to be a thriving civilization, and Dissolution was the
prophet of their god. When the city was overtaken by its current residents,
only Dissolution survived, for he alone turned faithfully to the Slime God.
Dissolution became a tremendous mass of acidic ooze, yet retained his
intelligence. He is filled with hatred for anything that can hold a form.

Dowan

A beautiful but vain elf with an aptitude for magic and little else. His skills
are the perfect complement of his twin sister Duvessa's fighting prowess.
%%%%
Duvessa

A plain-looking elven fighter who is technically brilliant in many forms of
combat, but over-confident because of it. She is complemented by the magical
skills of her twin brother, Dowan.
%%%%
Edmund

A jealous sibling of Sigmund (indeed, the youngest of nine brothers). He has
none of Sigmund's skills in magic, but makes up for it with his skills in
fighting and a canny head for money. He is eager to prove his superiority by
killing hapless adventurers with his expensive flail and quick wit.
%%%%
the Enchantress

A beautiful spriggan woman, the ruler of spriggans who live here. She wears an
opalescent outfit made of dragon skin that shimmers with all colours.

%%%%
Frances

A stout warrior who once bested a powerful lord of Pandemonium in combat,
gaining control over the demon's realm and thanes. The battle left her with a
deep facial scar, one that she carries as a badge of honour rather than a
symbol of shame.
%%%%
Frederick

A svelte fighter-mage who wears a gold-rimmed monocle and seeks a suitable and
worthy opponent. You likely do not fit the bill.
%%%%
Fannar

A cold-hearted elven sorcerer, draped in robes of high office. He whispers
grimly to himself as he stalks the dungeon, trailing ice crystals through the
air behind him.

In ages long past, Fannar's wisdom and precocious talent with frost magic won
him the coveted position of magistrate, placing him in charge of enforcing the
law throughout the Elven Halls. By all accounts, he was once well known for
being benevolent, just, and passionate in keeping the elves free from
corruption and crime, even as those around him began to dabble in necromancy
and demonic magic.

Over the long centuries of his tenure, Fannar's devotion to justice has warped
into paranoia and despotism. Even his closest supporters now whisper that his
magical power has begun to border on the self-destructive. Fannar still tries
to keep the elves from falling to evil, unwilling or unable to notice that he
failed long ago.
%%%%
Gastronok

A voracious and surprisingly intelligent slug, devoted to eating everything and
everyone he comes across, with a pointed hat perched rakishly atop his head. He
acquired the hat the same way he acquired his intelligence and his knowledge of
spells: by consuming their former owner, a powerful wizard.
%%%%

say that his silver horn is used to throw open the gates of Hell themselves.

final job. He hopes to settle down somewhere and live a quiet life with his
family, using the money from his final bounty: you.

Ignacio

While a mortal cannot turn into a demon aside from divine intervention, this is
what happened to Ignacio after Makhleb saw his love for his job and smiled upon
him. He is now slated to continue the joy of his life for all eternity.

Although his new form includes a number of large razor-sharp blades growing
from his demonic appendages, he kept his favourite axe and is eager to let you
test its edge.
%%%%
Ijyb

A small and twisted goblin, wearing some ugly blue rags. He claims dominion
over this level of the dungeon; the punishment for trespassing is death.
%%%%
Ilsuiw

A cunning merfolk water-witch, who uses her beauty and spellcraft to draw
unwitting adventurers to their deaths.
%%%%
Jessica

An evil apprentice sorceress. She entered the dungeon hoping to find a quiet,
secluded place where she could study the darker arts without being disturbed.
%%%%
Jorgrun

A deep dwarven magician, particularly well-attuned to the dungeon around him.
He wields powerful earth magic in combat.
%%%%
Jory

Once a simple village peasant, Jory found himself transformed in undeath into a
powerful creature. Through the countless centuries unlived since then, he has
honed his skills in combat and magic, amassed great wealth and many
possessions, and now resides in a stonily quiet Tower of Silence. He's not
about to let any puny adventurers ruin his hard work, so those who encounter
him should beware!
%%%%
Joseph

Looks like a mercenary.
%%%%
Josephine

A hideous crone, her face covered in warts, moles and the occasional patch of
hair, Josephine's appearance may fool one into thinking she is some weak old
woman, but she is truly a formidable necromancer. The use of black magic has
taken a physical toll on and prematurely aged Josephine, turning the once
beautiful lady into an ugly hag.

Khufu

An incredibly powerful emperor on the way to godhood.

%%%%
the Lernaean hydra

An ancient, outsized serpent-like water beast that possesses numerous heads.
The poets mention more heads than vase-painters can paint, poisonous venom
coming out of its eyes, and that this hydra is a guardian of an entrance to the
Underworld. What of this is true, you do not know.
%%%%
Lom Lobon

Stoic and inscrutable, Lom Lobon is an ancient demon infamous for his mastery
of magic. Rumoured to be the most learned being in the halls of Pandemonium, he
is at times sought out by mortal wizards who offer their souls in exchange for
the secrets of the arcane. Lacking the terrible wrath present in most demons,
Lom Lobon's single eye instead hides a cold, impartial cruelty.
%%%%
lorocyproca

A tall and gaunt figure, draped in long robes which flow as if alive. It
thirsts for magical energies.
%%%%
Louise

A mighty sorceress, clad from head to toe in heavy armour. Once an adventurer
looking for the fabled Orb of Zot, she was cast into the Abyss and got
hopelessly lost there. Toyed with by some greater power, she was stuck on the
hostile plane for nearly a decade. When she finally emerged from the Abyss,
Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now
wanders the halls of the dungeon, seeking other adventurers to share her fate.
%%%%
Mara

This tall and powerful demon is Mara, Lord of Illusions, mighty among dreamers.
He is capable of creating intricately detailed illusions, able to mislead even
the minds of the mightiest and most brilliant spell-casters.
%%%%
Margery

A lithe spellcaster in service to the powers of Hell; it is her duty to ensure
that the inhabitants of the Dungeon never forget their place. As a girl, she
personally slew the ancient dragon from whose hide her strange armour is
crafted.
%%%%
Maud

A mysterious warrior princess from a far-off kingdom, on a quest to retrieve
the legendary sword 'Entarex'. Countless have been the admirers who, thinking
about Maud, forgot everything else.
%%%%
Maurice

A sly, conniving thief. In his profession, Maurice is considered a legend — at
least according to himself. He is skilled, nonetheless, and among all the
thieves and rogues lured by the Orb, Maurice is undoubtedly the most crafty.
%%%%
Mennas

There was once a human priest named Mennas. He travelled far and wide preaching
of Zin to any who would listen, going even so far as to travel into Orcish
lands, preaching to orcs about laws and mercy. By all accounts the orcs were
not happy with Mennas. They demanded he swear Beogh was the one true god, and
when Mennas remained silent they cut out his tongue.

Whether or not this angel is that same Mennas is something of a mystery, as he
seems to have difficulty speaking.
%%%%
Menkaure

A fair and noble ruler of an ancient and mighty kingdom, mummified after an
early death. His faithful priests subsequently infused him with great and
powerful magic, seeking to grant him eternal life. Now he is forgotten and

A relaxed peace-in-death cultist with a healthy tan and a soothing voice. He
doesn't really care if it is you or him who dies — “both” would probably be the
best option.
%%%%
Pikel

While kobolds are normally slaves, Pikel's rough life, selfish ambition and
large stature have caused him to rise up and become a slaver himself. He is on
his way to the Orcish Mines to sell his wares, a selection of timid humans that
cower with every crack of his whip.
%%%%
Polyphemus

A cyclops shepherd, he is very protective of his charges, whom he watches with
an undying fervor through his single massive eye.
%%%%
Prince Ribbit

A handsome prince before he was cursed, he now adventures for a cure. On the

stays in place even after his transformation is a mystery.

saw in the dungeon to drive him mad, but his shrewd magical tactics and wicked
scythe now leave little time for his victims to wonder. Despite his reputation
as a vicious murderer, his grandiose and dramatic ways have earned him the
admiration of many denizens of the dungeon.

Snorg

A particularly corpulent troll with a short temper and a sizable gut.
Uninterested in the Orb, Snorg delights in the endless parade of adventurers -
that is, easy meals — it attracts.
%%%%
Sonja

A graceful kobold assassin. Admire her graceful pirouettes, thrill at her
daring leaps! But watch out for her knives!
%%%%
Terence

A violent murderer who kills for both pleasure and profit, Terence has been
forced into hiding after a botched job, and can't really afford to risk letting
anyone who has seen him leave the dungeon alive — there is a price on his head,
after all.
%%%%
Tiamat

A powerful dragon with mighty wings. Her scales seem to shimmer and change
colour as you watch.
%%%%
Urug

A coarse and lanky orc. Urug lost his eye in a fight with a harpy, and has

shield with a razored edge. It watches you through a pair of featureless chrome
spheres.

fearsome dragonish heads, rudimentary wings, tails, and a covering of tough
scales. In their mature form, their scales take on a distinct colouring, and

Whether draconians arose naturally, or are the product of twisted
experimentation by mad wizards on the crossbreeding of dragons and humans, is a
matter of much doubt.

dwarf cousins, yet less skilled in magical lore, dwarves excel in armed hand to
hand combat.

A species of bat that lives in mountain caves. How it got into the dungeon is a
mystery — probably something related to the sudden demise of dwarves in those

a brilliant column of raging flames.
%%%%

dispatch its victims.

an intruder.

simple pleasures of the flesh. Halflings excel at moving silently.

hydra

A great and nightmarish lacertilian beast. It has many heads, and the potential
to grow many more!

Hitting it with any cutting weapon bigger than a dagger or a quick blade risks

want unless the blade is hot enough to cauterize the wound. Even a troll's
claws may be enough to rip hydra heads.
%%%%
hyperactive ballistomycete

This ballistomycete is in a state of all-out reproduction. It is constantly

its prey, ensnaring it. Those who see it in action and live to tell the tale
say the speed with which it leaps is almost supernatural.

nature belies its fragile appearance.
%%%%
killer bee

you will serve as the middle step in the food chain.

apricot tree

<apple tree>
%%%%
archer statue

The likeness of a beautiful elven archer, sculpted in finest marble. It holds a
bow aloft, and appears to be magically animated, letting it use the bow to
riddle you with arrows.

Being a statue, it doesn't appear to have a means of salvaging shot arrows or
fletching new ones, but you guess the statue's creators gave it enough of a
supply to kill you before someone comes to replenish the quiver.
%%%%
bittermelon vine

An ordinary looking plant, growing some barely edible fruits. They provide
nutrition, but certainly not good taste.
%%%%
black sheep

On first glance, this sheep has merely a different pigmentation, but you are

hiding inside, _then_ covered by another layer of sheep skin to better deceive

Or, maybe, it's just a sheep after all.
%%%%
centaur hunter

This particularly battle-adept centaur is an extremely precise shot with its
longbow.
%%%%

every monstrous creature imaginable.
%%%%
citrus tree

<apple tree>

conjurer statue

This statue seems to harness the mightiest pure conjurations ever devised by

This crystal golem is so ensorcelled that it is immune to nearly any magic
itself, and it can also shoot powerful beams of fire and cold at any

demonic plant

Just as demons are shaped in a mockery of living beings, this... thing... here

demonspawn sorcerer

The air crackles around this demonic-looking humanoid; it clearly wields magic
of some power.
%%%%
draconian transmuter

A draconian who has eschewed the study of weaponry, training in the art of

earth elementalist statue

A plain statue of a dwarf wielding a pickaxe. It looks incredibly heavy.

fire elementalist statue

An ornately worked statue of an orc holding a torch aloft, hewn from black

An ineptly made statue of a mage. Its magic keeps leaking, letting you know
what kind of spells you can expect: cold-based ones.

Without a gardener to provide it with something to prop itself over, and not
being lucky enough to have its seed fall near something it can climb, this
grape vine is still remarkably hard to step over.
%%%%
greater air elemental

<air elemental>
%%%%
grey elf

Once considered a unique species of its own, grey elves are now more properly
classified as a sub-species of high elf. Little exists to distinguish them from
their high elf cousins, aside from their supposed glamour (which is probably
more myth than fact).
%%%%
high elf sorcerer

This apparently adventurous high elf is just as proficient in magic as its deep
elven brethren.
%%%%
hill dwarf

Hill dwarves are a subrace of dwarves who, as their name implies, live on
hills. Once able adventurers, the hill dwarves no longer have any interest in
dungeon delving. This one was captured specially for this exhibit.

While most halfling adventurers prefer stealth to direct combat, here stands
one of the exceptions. Size is no diminishment to this stout warrior's

divine powers granted to Yredelemnul's followers.
%%%%
minotaur fighter

A particularly adventurous and battle-ready minotaur, capable of out-fighting
even its mighty brethren.
%%%%
minotaur gladiator

A particularly adventurous and sharp-eyed minotaur, capable of landing
astonishingly precise and brutal blows from afar with javelins.
%%%%
minotaur monk

A particularly adventurous and agile minotaur, capable of tearing apart the
unwary with naught but its bare hands.
%%%%
mountain dwarf

Mountain dwarves are surface-dwelling relatives of the deep dwarves. After
years of war with the taller but otherwise quite similar hill orcs, the
mountain dwarves were conquered and driven from these lands. This one has been
imported from foreign shores.
%%%%
mummy sorcerer

An ancient magician, embalmed and cursed to walk in undeath for all eternity.
Even in undeath, it retains many of its powers of magic.
%%%%
mummy summoner

An ancient mystic, embalmed and cursed to walk in undeath for all eternity.
Even in undeath, it holds the power to call forth great legions of infernal
creatures.
%%%%
mummy warrior

<guardian mummy>
%%%%
musa plant

This bushy plant can grow bananas. Or are they banananas? Or bananananas? Some
yellow curved thingies, at least.
%%%%
ogre berserker

A particularly large, hungry, and blood-thirsty ogre, capable of flying into a
mighty rage at the slightest hint of food.
%%%%
# Sprint only, too unhinged for regular games...
oklob plant annihilator

It would seem inconceivable that a mere plant could attain sentience and the
use of magic, but that's what you see here. What sorcery is it?

%%%%
orb of electricity

A massive floating ball. It resembles ball lightning, but looks far more
stable. It definitely lacks some heavy-duty insulation, though.
%%%%
# I'm not sure how widely cosmogonical Norse myths are known to an average
# reader; Crawl's audience tends to be far more educated though, so let's
# hope the concepts of Ginnungagap, Niflheim and Muspelheim are not too
# obscure.
orb of ice

A globe of primordial ice, floating in the air. You don't know whether the
tales about the world's once being a void bracketed by realms of endless fire
and cold are true, but if they are, this orb may be a relic of that ancient
time.

Ordinary ice seems to form on the surface, but it is easy to distinguish from
the perfect ball inside. You'd better stay far away, or you may end up frozen.
%%%%
orb slug

A monstrously big slug who apparently ate a mighty conjurer, or maybe an orb
spider. Or perhaps it's a product of divine experiments, in which case it looks
like Xom's handiwork...
%%%%
orc berserker

A tough, strong, and particularly angry orc.
%%%%
petrified plant

Something has turned these ordinary plants into stone. Better not tarry here.
If whatever petrified these plants gets you as well, we'll be stuck with a
statue as ugly as you standing here for ages.
%%%%
phase spider

An otherworldly spider that can move short and medium distances by briefly
shifting between the planes of reality, in order to better ensnare its prey.
%%%%
pristine statue

An immaculately sculpted porphyry statue of an archer poised to release an
arrow, with a full quiver at the hip. The individually sculpted arrows look
almost as if they could be removed one by one and used in a real bow.
%%%%
pyrus tree

<apple tree>
%%%%
rock troll monk

It seems a flimsy representation of a monk; nothing more than a half-formed
memory.
%%%%
sacrificial human

From the look of things, she was supposed to be sacrificed in some
demon-summoning ritual.
%%%%
sickly siren

A young woman with a fish tail in place of legs. She looks quite sick, but
still capable of bespelling her audience.
%%%%
sludge elf earth mage

A sludge elf particularly well-attuned to the powers of earth.
%%%%
skeletal archer

Since when is having flesh a requirement to be a master archer? These skeletal
fellows can turn you into a bloody hedgehog with ease. Meatlings like you are
only good for a supply of sinew for bowstrings anyway.
%%%%
soapberry tree

<apple tree>
%%%%
spooky statue

You sense a ghostly presence around this statue, and it's not the slightest bit
friendly.
%%%%
spriggan enchanter

A spriggan particularly skilled in the arts of hexes and charms - and,
apparently, lethal with a quick blade.
%%%%
spriggan necromancer

Raising the dead, and then running behind them... these tricks start getting
annoying.
%%%%
spriggan shepherd

Being unable to digest meat, spriggans here need quite a lot of milk to
maintain a healthy diet. This guy guards the animals from predators and vandals
like you, brandishing a crooked cane that looks like a fine tool for teaching
you some respect.
%%%%
strange machine

A glistening silver machine.
%%%%
strawberry plant

The same radiation that made cockroaches and spiders the size of small dogs
didn't spare this humble strawberry plant, either. Fortunately, even with its
size, it appears to be harmless.
%%%%
succubus

A female demon who uses her charms to seduce humanoid males. If you wish to
take advantage of her, however, you will fail: she seems very angry right now
and has blood more on her mind than fun.
%%%%
tengu aerator

This particularly ferocious tengu is well on its way towards mastery of air
magic.
%%%%
water elementalist statue

A smooth, charming statue of a beautiful mermaid bathing in a fountain,
sculpted from creamy, faintly pinkish travertine. It glistens softly in the
light, as if sprinkled in actual water.
%%%%
young halfling

This halfling has been caught by kobolds, and was meant to be roasted and eaten
before you unceremoniously interrupted. Don't you have any manners? Didn't you
ever learn not to disrupt people's meals?
%%%%
young spriggan druid

A junior member of the order of spriggans sworn to protect nature. While less
dangerous than the elders, this one is perfectly capable of dealing with
trespassers like you.

{{
    if you.god() == "Fedhas" then
        return "Those foul druids care mostly for animals, instead of " ..
               "taking proper care of plants as Fedhas commands.";
    end
}}
%%%%
vampire enchanter

An enchanter who, by accident or design, has been afflicted with the curse of
the vampire. Regardless, undeath merely fuels their abilities; few are aware of
its presence until they find themselves on the wrong end of a quick blade.
%%%%
vampire noble

<vampire>
%%%%
vampire warrior

This vampire, formidable in combat, uses magic only for self-boosts, preferring
hand to hand combat to deal with pesky interlopers.
%%%%
vine covered stone golem

While made of ordinary old weathered stone, covered with moss and vines, this
golem still needs to be respected. It is still hard as stone, after all, and
its weight spells massive damage if it connects a blow.
%%%%
warrior statue

This statue depicts a gruff warrior, wielding a mean two-handed weapon. Since
it appears to be capable of moving its arms, keeping your distance seems to be
the only way to keep your vital organs undamaged.
%%%%
witch

An old and unnaturally ugly human, wearing
robes stained with what appears to be swamp ooze, cauldron soot and brew
ingredients.

A magician with such stellar sanity and manners probably has great pets as well.
You might not have to wait long to find out for certain.
%%%%
withered plant

This plant lost the war against life-draining influences, and yet its physical
form is intact. Its dead body stays here uneaten, as the small creatures that
would naturally decompose it prefer to stay away. And it looks like this plant
died many {{ if you.branch() == "Crypt" or you.branch() == "Tomb" then return
"centuries"; else return "years"; end }} ago.
%%%%
wizard statue

In this land of magic, it'd be foolish to assume that a statue of a wizard is
always an inert piece of rock. This statue's hands and staff have very little
dust compared to the base, suggesting it is capable of making magical gestures.
The trap is too obvious, but dealing with it might not be.
%%%%
zot statue

An utterly bizarre statue, hewn from a single piece of dark gabbro
scintillating with tiny crystals. It is impossible to tell whether the statue
is intended to represent some creature or personage, or is completely abstract.
One thing is certain: it is profoundly disturbing.
