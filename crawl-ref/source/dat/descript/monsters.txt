Once the primary guardian serpent of a legendary treasure hoard, he was

corrupt and tainted, a powerful demon who lords over the frozen wastes of
Cocytus. His strength is legendary.

present form: half-human, half-spider. Her sympathies now lie with the inhuman

One of the arch-demons who dwell in the depths of Hell, wreathed in fire.

Asterion

Once a king infamous for waging bloodthirsty campaigns, Asterion was exiled to

destructive might.

The Pits of Slime used to be a thriving civilization, and Dissolution was the
prophet of their god. When the city was overtaken by its current residents,

A stout warrior who once bested a powerful lord of Pandemonium in combat,
gaining control over the demon's realm and thanes. The battle left her with a
deep facial scar, one that she carries as a badge of honour rather than a
symbol of shame.
%%%%
Frederick

A svelte fighter-mage with a gold-rimmed monocle, a keen sense of tradition,

long time.
%%%%
Gastronok

what happened to Ignacio after Makhleb saw his love for his job and smiled upon
him. He is now slated to continue the joy of his life for all eternity.

Although his new form includes a number of large razor-sharp blades growing
from his demonic appendages, he kept his favourite axe and is eager to let you

they were matchsticks. Its many heads slaver and gnash constantly as it hunts
for prey to slake its bottomless appetite.
%%%%
Lom Lobon

Stoic and inscrutable, Lom Lobon is an ancient demon infamous for his mastery
of magic. Rumoured to be the most learned being in the halls of Pandemonium, he
is at times sought out by mortal wizards who offer their souls in exchange for
the secrets of the arcane. Lacking the terrible wrath present in most demons,
Lom Lobon's single eye instead hides a cold, impartial cruelty.
%%%%
Louise

A mighty sorceress, clad from head to toe in heavy armour. Once an adventurer
looking for the fabled Orb of Zot, she was cast into the Abyss and got
hopelessly lost there. Toyed with by some greater power, she was stuck on the

Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now
wanders the halls of the dungeon, seeking other adventurers to share her fate.

the legendary sword ‘Entarex’. Countless have been the admirers who, thinking
about Maud, forgot everything else.

thieves and rogues lured by the Orb, Maurice is undoubtedly the most crafty.
%%%%
Menkaure

A fair and noble ruler of an ancient and mighty kingdom, mummified after an
early death. His faithful priests subsequently infused him with great and
powerful magic, seeking to grant him eternal life. Now he is forgotten and
reduced to mouldering bandages and dry, brittle bones.
%%%%
Mennas

There was once a human priest named Mennas. He travelled far and wide preaching
of Zin to any who would listen, going even so far as to travel into Orcish
lands, preaching to orcs about laws and mercy. By all accounts the orcs were
not happy with Mennas. They demanded he swear Beogh was the one true god, and
when Mennas remained silent they cut out his tongue.

Whether or not this angel is that same Mennas is something of a mystery, as he
seems to have difficulty speaking.

A brilliant scientist obsessed with electricity. In his attempts to perfect his
electric golem, he was involved in a terrible accident, and now phases in and
out of reality.

doesn't really care if it is you or him who dies — “both” would probably be the
best option.
%%%%
Pikel

While kobolds are normally slaves, Pikel's rough life, selfish ambition and
large stature have caused him to rise up and become a slaver himself. He is on
his way to the Orcish Mines to sell his wares, a selection of timid humans who
cower with every crack of his whip.

as a vicious murderer, his grandiose and dramatic ways have earned him the
admiration of many denizens of the dungeon.

be swamp ooze, cauldron soot and brew ingredients.
%%%%
withered plant

This plant lost the war against life-draining influences, and yet its physical
form is intact. Its dead body stays here uneaten, as the small creatures that
would naturally decompose it prefer to stay away. And it looks like this plant
died many {{ if you.branch() == "Crypt" or you.branch() == "Tomb" then return
"centuries"; else return "years"; end }} ago.
%%%%
zin angel

A divine agent of Zin, it is a towering winged figure with an aura of brilliant
white light. This angel's face, though, is marked by a scowl, as if its zeal
against any real or perceived vice overshadows its goodness.
%%%%
zot statue

An utterly bizarre statue, hewn from a single piece of dark gabbro
scintillating with tiny crystals. It is impossible to tell whether the statue
is intended to represent some creature or personage, or is completely abstract.
One thing is certain: it is profoundly disturbing.

### Meatsprint
bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. It is a
horrendous imitation of the human form, consisting of an unrecognisable mass of
meat stitched together with limbs sewn on seemingly at random. Its skin hangs
off loosely in some places and bulges repulsively in others. Each one bears a
large symbol carved into its flesh, a mark of pride from its twisted creator.
%%%%
large bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its
bloated hulk pulsates and throbs constantly with accursed fires. It looks as if
it could explode into a torrent of viscera at any moment.
%%%%
meat berserker

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its form
is large and muscular. It moves swiftly and with impetuous fury, the sole
thought within its being to rend you apart with great fervour. As it rages, it
creates a cacophonous din.
%%%%
meat hydra

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Each of
its eight necks is distended and elongated, connected to a colossal body
crumpled and dripping with ichor. Its many heads spew blood while writhing and
convulsing in agony, as it brings torment to itself and anything else that
beholds its foul visage.
%%%%
meat beast

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Ablaze
with demonic frenzy, it gores and tramples with ferocity unmatched. Its skin is
flayed, exposing the glistening tendons and sinew underneath, and the teeth
inside its cavernous maw are stained with blood.
%%%%
sculptor of flesh

An artisan of unlife, the sculptor appears as a grim skeletal form. It has six
long arms ending in mangled hands with broken fingers, upon which it crawls
like a spider. Its skull is abnormally large and full of holes. Its bones are
reddened and fractured, inscribed with the unholy spells it weaves to assemble
its puppets.
%%%%
destroyer

The destroyers begin to descend upon you. They come in numbers and with wrath,
maws gaping like abaddon, bottomless and abyssal. They bring your doom and will
feast on your remains.
%%%%
accursed

The accursed are the ones who came before. They have come to ensure you share
their fate.
%%%%
tyrant

A colossal mass of bones and skulls, a walking tomb. You hear shrieks and
screams as it approaches, shattering off bones with each crushing step,
reassembling itself in eternal unrest.
%%%%
dread

An affront to existence, a void in which there is only torment and hellfire.
Its unearthly form is torn and twisted, black and hollow. It is bereft of
rational thought, knowing only hatred and the desire to desecrate your soul.
%%%%
scourge

A vast serpentine form with raw and diseased skin, seeping bile and pus,
spouting venom and blight.
%%%%
observer

You see the unseen, you stare and they stare back. They whisper and laugh, they
grin and cry, they leer at you with contempt and gaze at you in adoration. They
are the observers, they are the judge of your worth and will decide your end.
%%%%
wretched soul

A spectre, struggling to leave the mortal world it is incarcerated in. It
drains life and unlife from all those it comes into contact with.
%%%%
fleshlord

One of the greatest servants of the Meatlord. It is muscular, agile and full of
malevolence.
%%%%
vile

An emaciated figure brimming with hellfire and plague. Its appearance signifies
the end of days.
%%%%
The Servant

His glaive is alight with the flames of hell.
%%%%
The Captor

Those who enter will not escape.
%%%%
The Defiler

His shield is emblazoned with images of infernal flames.
%%%%
The Meatlord

You behold the embodiment of filth, corruption and depravity, the Meatlord. His
foul body is bloated to the extreme, leaking viscous fluid and the stench of
death. His head is that of a boar with bulging eyes and tusks split in two, his
snout flares and oozes as he snorts and squeals at the sight of you, his mouth
is a toothless rift which drools pools of blood and vomits forth disgusting
remains. His neck is stretched and lops forward, its skin sagging downward. His
immense gut writhes and distorts as the larvae within await their repugnant
release. His legs are unrecognisable masses of flesh, covered in protrusions
and throbbing boils. Your mind reels at the sight of this hideous form and your
senses begin to shut down in an attempt to preserve your sanity as you choke on
the oppressive stench.
%%%%
The Unspeakable

You hear the echoes of planets behind the deafening roar of stars as it
approaches. It is the jaws of the abyss. It brings forth crawling chaos from
within. It is the last sight you will ever see.
