"Then gave I her, -- so tutor'd by my art, --	 
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease."
	-William Shakespeare, _Romeo and Juliet_
