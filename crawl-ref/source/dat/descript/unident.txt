potion:quote

“Then gave I her, — so tutor’d by my art, —
 A sleeping potion; which so took effect
 As I intended, for it wrought on her
 The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
 That he should hither come as this dire night,
 To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
 Being the time the potion’s force should cease.”
    -William Shakespeare, _Romeo and Juliet_

 It helps me wade across a river when the bridge is down. It accompanies me to
the village on a moonless night. If you call it a staff, you will enter hell
like an arrow.”
