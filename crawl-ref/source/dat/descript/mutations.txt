when launching melee attacks. Each level of this mutation makes your stinger
sharper, longer, and stronger.

your attacks to become weakened for a short while. The second level of this

this mutation makes it easier for you to lose your temper.

allows more distant monsters to be affected. The third level of this mutation
also allows you to paralyse monsters in the same way while zapping wands.
%%%%
icemail mutation

You are coated in a protective layer of ice. Fiery attacks can temporarily melt

weapons and defences. The second level of this mutation makes matters even
worse, adding a chance that your wretched victims may become mutated and

them. This can weaken foes, drain their health, or disrupt their magic.

sound. This prevents most forms of spellcasting and prayer, though demonic
magic, being noiseless, is unaffected.

unpredictable and unaffected by your choice of god. You cannot train specific
spell schools - you can either train all spell schools at once, or none.
%%%%
hp casting mutation

Each level of this mutation increases your maximum health by 4 points.

one pair and a shield with the other, as well as wear a second pair of gloves.
You can even wield extremely large weapons like giant clubs, though this takes
both arm-pairs.
%%%%
retaliatory headbutt mutation

When a foe misses you in melee, you may reflexively retaliate, attempting to
gore your attacker with your horns.
%%%%
multi-lived mutation

Every third experience level, you gain an extra life. If you are slain while

floor. You can continue to gain extra lives even once you reach the maximum
experience level, but you can't have more than two extra lives at a time.
%%%%
distributed training mutation

cannot choose to focus. Effects that prevent you from training certain skills,
such as divine restrictions, do not cause your other skills to rise faster.
%%%%
nimble swimmer mutation

You can blend into the waves while swimming through water or flying above it,
gaining Stealth+. The second level of this mutation also grants you improved
evasion and increases your movement speed when in or above water.
%%%%
divine attributes mutation

Your divine heritage dramatically boosts your attribute gain (Strength,
Intelligence, and Dexterity) as you level up relative to other species, both
in quantity and in how much you can control your development. Every three
levels, you choose an attribute to increase by four points.
%%%%
tentacles mutation

Your gelatinous body has eight tentacles that help you move around in shallow
or deep water and can be used to constrict enemies while attacking them in
melee. Each tentacle can wear a ring, but you need four of them to move around,
and either two or four tentacles to hold a weapon depending on its size, and
two tentacles to hold a shield.

Your tentacles will try to constrict foes which you attack in melee. (You cannot
constrict monsters larger than you.) Independently, you have a two-thirds chance
of launching a damaging 'squeeze' attack whenever you attack in melee.
%%%%
mertail mutation

Your morphogenic matrix is unstable, allowing your lower body to shift to
a powerful aquatic tail when in shallow or deep water. It will quickly
reform into legs once you leave the water. When in merform, your tail allows
you to tail-slap foes when launching melee attacks.
%%%%
+LOS mutation

The darkness flees at your approach, allowing an extended range of vision and
ranged attack (+1 line of sight), but also allowing you to be seen and
potentially targeted from further away.
%%%%
no regeneration mutation

You do not regenerate health while resting, and are unable to receive the
effects of magic that hastens the speed of regeneration. Sources of HP gain
such as potions and religious invocations will still heal you, and certain
divine invocations can temporarily grant you the ability to regenerate.
To compensate, you are able to heal yourself via the
<input>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</input> key, at the cost of permanent MP.
%%%%
strong nose mutation

You have a powerful nose adapted to the Dungeon's scents, allowing you to
detect where treasures lay hidden. As you explore the dungeon, nearby item
locations that you cannot directly see will gain a marker for
as-yet-undiscovered items.

attacks, auxiliary attacks, and spells. The third level of this mutation also

Your skin is transparent, improving your stealth and reducing the accuracy of
your foes' attacks against you. Each level of this mutation reduces your foes'
accuracy further.
%%%%
tendrils mutation

When struck in melee, the slimy tendrils covering your body may grab your
attacker's weapon and yank it from their grasp, disarming them.
%%%%
jelly sensing items mutation

You have a small jelly attached to you that senses nearby items.
%%%%
jelly absorbing missiles mutation

When struck by a missile (such as an arrow or crossbow bolt), a jelly on your
body may eat it, healing you somewhat.
%%%%
engulf mutation

Your melee attacks may engulf living foes that are your size or smaller.
Those foes will be silenced and unable to breathe.
%%%%
otherworldly mutation

You are foreign to this world, easily perceived by dark forces. You have only
one-tenth the normal time on each dungeon floor before Zot finds you and
permanently reduces your health.
%%%%
foul shadow mutation

Your body is shadowed by foul flame. Foes hit you less often, and your stealth
is greatly enhanced. Foes who strike you in melee are sometimes seared by the
foul flame; undead and demonic foes take less damage from it, while holy beings
and good god worshippers take more.
%%%%
explore regen mutation

You are invigorated by the discovery of the unknown. As you explore the dungeon,
your wounds will heal and your magic will replenish.
%%%%
faith mutation

You were embalmed with holy oils and sacred spices and bound about with blessed
cloth. Now you have a special connection with the divine, allowing you to gain
favour with your chosen god more quickly.
%%%%
devour on kill mutation

When you kill living creatures you have a chance to devour their life force
and restore health.

second level of this mutation regenerates both magic and health.
%%%%
double potion healing mutation

Whenever a potion restores your health or magic, it restores twice as much.
%%%%
drunken brawling mutation

Whenever you drink a potion that restores health or magic, you perform an
immediate attack against all enemies adjacent to you.

(This includes potions of curing, heal wounds, magic, and ambrosia.)
%%%%
artefact enchanting mutation

You can use scrolls of enchant weapon and armour upon random artefacts.

This cannot raise their enchantment above what would normally be possible on a
mundane item of the same type, and cannot affect especially unusual artefacts
at all.
%%%%
runic magic mutation

You cast spells with the assistance of glyphs marked upon your armour, greatly
reducing the complex movements which would otherwise be required.

(The encumbrance rating of all armour you wear is reduced by 1/2 for purposes
of spell success.)
%%%%
off-hand wielding mutation

You can wield a one-handed weapon in your off-hand, if not wielding a
two-handed weapon or wearing a shield or orb. You will follow up attacks from
your primary weapon with your off-hand weapon, with attack delay determined
by the average of the two. Ranged weapons can only follow attacks by ranged
weapons, and likewise melee weapons.
%%%%
slow wielding mutation

You must recalibrate your grasping arms when wielding or unwielding weapons.
This takes as long as donning armour.
%%%%
warmup strikes mutation

Your grasping arms need time to limber up, making your first few attacks in
each fight less effective. Slow, heavy attacks help more than fast attacks.
Both weapon-based and unarmed attacks are affected.
%%%%
no rings mutation

Your hands are embedded into the controls for your grasping arms, leaving you
with no place to wear magical rings without disastrous magical interference.
%%%%
iron-fused scales mutation

Your scales are fused with a thick layer of iron, giving them resilience akin to
a suit of armour (+5 AC).
%%%%
inviolate magic mutation

Your magic is resistant to distruption by outside forces. Hostile effects which
drain your MP drain only 1/3 as much and you are immune to having your magical
effects be removed by anyone but yourself.
%%%%
formless mutation

You have no physical body and instead interact with the world through haunting
objects. This allows you to 'equip' up to 6 boots, gloves, cloaks, or helmets in
any combination, but body armour is too large for you to usefully manipulate in
this fashion.

At higher levels, you can even send the armour you are haunting out to attack
enemies independently for short periods of time.
%%%%
trickster mutation

Your connection to the realm of the living grows stronger as you spread
misfortune.

Whenever you or your allies inflict new negative status effects upon nearby
enemies (other than poison), your AC temporarily increases. This bonus improves
with the number of different enemies affected, but will decay over time if you
do not continue to inflict new misfortune.

At your current XL, you can gain a maximum bonus of
{{return 6 + you.xl() * 4 / 5;}} AC this way.
%%%%
mnemnophage mutation

You devour the memories and even the very existence of those you kill, subsuming
them in the unholy fire that wreathes your body.

Once you have accumulated enough memories, you may choose to burn them all away
as fuel to greatly enhance your spellcasting for a short period of time.

At your current experience level, you can hold enough memories to cast a maximum
of {{return 3 + math.floor(you.xl() * 3 / 20);}} spells in a row this way.
%%%%
spellclaws mutation

You instinctually channel destructive magic through your claws. When casting a
damage-dealing spell, you also perform a melee attack against the most healthy
enemy in your attack range.

This attack does reduced damage if your attack speed is slower than your casting
speed.
# ------ Fakemut descriptions ------
%%%%
vampire fangs mutation

When you perform a stab attack against a living monster with blood, you heal for
a portion of the total damage dealt. When you are at 50% of your max HP or less,
this has a chance to happen on all melee attacks which increases with your
Shapeshifting skill.
%%%%
bloodcurse mutation

When you kill a living monster with a stab attack, they may rise again to serve
you as a vampiric thrall. Thralls possess all the abilities they had in life,
but are undead, and gain a vampiric bite attack. Spellcaster thralls will also
gain knowledge of the Vampiric Draining spell.

You can only create a thrall if you do not have one already, and they will
inevitably turn to dust after a short time.
%%%%
insubstantial mutation

You are insubstantial and immune to many effects that require a solid body. You
cannot be constricted, petrified, engulfed, skewered by barbs, covered in sticky

Brilliance.
%%%%

Your Infernal Servants are now summoned adjacent to a random enemy instead of
near you. When they appear, they do so in a blast of your characteristic
Destruction (which cannot hurt you or other allies).

%%%%
Mark of the Legion mutation

Your Infernal Servant ability is replaced with Infernal Legion, allowing you to
call in a small army of demons over time. While individually short-lived, their
numbers are inexhaustible for as long as the status lasts, and they will never
be hostile to you.

You may also unleash Makhleb's Destruction through your summoned allies without
harming them.
%%%%
Mark of Annihilation mutation

Your Infernal Servant ability is replaced with Globe of Annihilation, allowing
you to hurl slow-moving spheres of intense destructive force that detonate
in an enormous blast of your characteristic Destruction.

When you kill enemies, they have a small chance to explode in a violent rain of
gore, which damages adjacent foes proportional to the victim's maximum health.

Enemies who die to this explosion will always explode themselves.
%%%%
Mark of the Celebrant mutation

Whenever you fall below 50% of your maximum HP, you perform an infernal rite,
unleashing a flurry of blood arrows aimed at nearby enemies. You will fire at
least one arrow for every valid target, but may fire additional ones if few are
present. Invocations increases the damage of these arrows, and Makhleb will
always bestow healing upon you for enemies killed by them.

After performing a blood rite, you cannot perform another until your HP has
fully recovered.
%%%%
Mark of Execution mutation

A demonic incarnation of murder lies dormant within your soul. Whenever you kill
an enemy in melee, there is a small chance for it to awaken and manifest as a
maelstrom of scythe-like blades enveloping you. These blades will attack
whenever you do and also retaliate whenever you successfully dodge an enemy
attack.

You have the ability to rampage swiftly towards enemies while possessed, but if
you spend more than a short while doing anything other than attacking, the
demonic presence will go dormant inside you once again.
%%%%
Mark of Atrocity mutation

Your Unleash Destruction is empowered the more times you use it consecutively
without pause, increasing in both damage and health cost. Upon using it a fourth
time in a row, you will automatically unleash a wild barrage of additional bolts
aimed at random targets and reset this boost.
%%%%
Mark of the Fanatic mutation

Grants you the Vessel of Slaughter ability, allowing you to transform into a
powerful demonic avatar with greatly boosted offence and defence for a short
period of time, in exchange for being dragged down into the Crucible of Flesh
