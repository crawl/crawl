A vile yet invigorating energy permeates your soul, which resonates with

portion of their life force and magical power. Each level of this mutation
increases the chance this happens and the amount one siphons.

if you aren't wearing gloves. If your off-hand is free, the strength of your
off-hand punch attacks is also increased. Each level of this mutation makes your
nails sharper, longer, and stronger. The third level of this mutation prevents
you from wearing gloves.
%%%%
demonic touch mutation

Your hands glow with unholy energy, allowing you to inflict irresistible damage
when launching melee attacks as long as your off-hand is free. Your touch
attacks deal damage which ignores armour, and each level of this mutation

wearing gloves, and also causes your touch attacks to reduce your foes'

and any slaying bonuses.

when launching melee attacks. Each level of this mutation makes your stinger
sharper, longer, and stronger.

allows more distant monsters to be affected. The third level of this mutation
also allows you to paralyse monsters in the same way while zapping wands.
%%%%
icemail mutation

You are coated in a protective layer of ice. Fiery attacks can temporarily melt
the ice, removing the protection until the ice reforms. Each level of this
mutation increases the protection imparted.

miscast spells.

a cloud of flame. Each level of this mutation makes this more likely. This
mutation also grants you immunity to clouds of flame.
# XXX: also mention that this makes people more likely to bleed?
%%%%
corrupting presence mutation

weapons and defences. The second level of this mutation makes matters even
worse, adding a chance that your wretched victims may become mutated and

them. This can weaken foes, drain their health, or disrupt their magic.
%%%%

sound. This prevents most forms of spellcasting and prayer, though demonic
magic, being noiseless, is unaffected.

%%%%
innate caster mutation

You cannot learn spells from books. Instead, as you gain experience, spells
of higher and higher level bubble up from your fiery heart. These spells are
unpredictable and unaffected by your choice of god. You cannot train specific
spell schools - you can either train all spell schools at once, or none.
%%%%
hp casting mutation

You have no separate reserve of magical power, and anything that would affect
MP has no effect on you. When casting spells, using abilities, or doing anything
else that *costs* MP for normal species, you spend HP instead.

Each level of this mutation increases your maximum health by 4 points.

%%%%
stealthy paws mutation

When launching attacks on unaware or incapacitated enemies, you inflict extra
damage in the same way as a human with a short blade might.
%%%%
four strong arms mutation

You have two pairs of two arms, allowing you to wield two-handed weapons with
one pair and a shield with the other, as well as wear a second pair of gloves.
You can even wield extremely large weapons like giant clubs, though this takes
both arm-pairs.
%%%%
retaliatory headbutt mutation

When a foe misses you in melee, you may reflexively retaliate, attempting to
gore your attacker with your horns.
%%%%
multi-lived mutation

Every third experience level, you gain an extra life. If you are slain while
you still have a life remaining, you will reappear elsewhere on the current
floor. You can continue to gain extra lives even once you reach the maximum
experience level, but you can't have more than two extra lives at a time.
%%%%
distributed training mutation

cannot choose to focus. Effects that prevent you from training certain skills,
such as divine restrictions, do not cause your other skills to rise faster.
%%%%

You can blend into the waves while swimming through water or flying above it,
gaining Stealth+. The second level of this mutation also grants you improved
evasion and increases your movement speed when in or above water.
%%%%
divine attributes mutation

Intelligence, and Dexterity) as you level up relative to other species, both
in quantity and in how much you can control your development. Every three
levels, you choose an attribute to increase by four points.
%%%%
tentacles mutation

Your gelatinous body has eight tentacles that help you move around in shallow
or deep water and can be used to constrict enemies while attacking them in
melee. Each tentacle can wear a ring, but you need four of them to move around,
and either two or four tentacles to hold a weapon depending on its size, and
two tentacles to hold a shield.

Your tentacles will try to constrict foes which you attack in melee. (You cannot
constrict monsters larger than you.) Independently, you have a two-thirds chance
of launching a damaging 'squeeze' attack whenever you attack in melee.
%%%%
mertail mutation

Your morphogenic matrix is unstable, allowing your lower body to shift to
a powerful aquatic tail when in shallow or deep water. It will quickly
reform into legs once you leave the water. When in merform, your tail allows
you to tail-slap foes when launching melee attacks.
%%%%
+LOS mutation

The darkness flees at your approach, allowing an extended range of vision and
ranged attack (+1 line of sight), but also allowing you to be seen and
potentially targeted from further away.
%%%%
no regeneration mutation

You do not regenerate health while resting, and are unable to receive the
effects of magic that hastens the speed of regeneration. Sources of HP gain
such as potions and religious invocations will still heal you, and certain
divine invocations can temporarily grant you the ability to regenerate.
To compensate, you are able to heal yourself via the
<input>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</input> key, at the cost of permanent MP.
%%%%
treasure sense mutation

You have an uncanny knack for knowing where items can be found. As you explore
the dungeon, nearby item locations that you cannot directly see will gain a
marker for as-yet-undiscovered items.
%%%%

gelatinous body mutation

Your body is rubbery, and your foes like glue. Each level of this mutation
confers +1 AC and +1 EV.

Each level of this mutation improves your accuracy with weapons, unarmed
attacks, auxiliary attacks, and spells. The third level of this mutation also
allows you to see invisible foes.
%%%%

Your skin is transparent, improving your stealth and reducing the accuracy of
your foes' attacks against you. Each level of this mutation reduces your foes'
accuracy further.
%%%%
slime shroud mutation

When struck in melee, the slimy shroud covering your body may deflect the
attack. Such deflection will break the shroud, however, and it will take time
for it to reconstitute itself.
%%%%
tendrils mutation

When struck in melee, the slimy tendrils covering your body may grab your
attacker's weapon and yank it from their grasp, disarming them.
%%%%
jelly sensing items mutation

You have a small jelly attached to you that senses nearby items.
%%%%
jelly absorbing missiles mutation

When struck by a missile (such as an arrow or crossbow bolt), a jelly on your
body may eat it, healing you somewhat.
%%%%
engulf mutation

Your melee attacks may engulf living foes that are your size or smaller.
Those foes will be silenced and unable to breathe.
%%%%
otherworldly mutation

You are foreign to this world, easily perceived by dark forces. You have only
one-tenth the normal time on each dungeon floor before Zot finds you and
permanently reduces your health.
%%%%
foul shadow mutation

Your body is shadowed by foul flame. Foes hit you less often, and your stealth
is greatly enhanced. Foes who strike you in melee are sometimes seared by the
foul flame; undead and demonic foes take less damage from it, while holy beings
and good god worshippers take more.
%%%%
explore regen mutation

You are invigorated by the discovery of the unknown. As you explore the dungeon,
your wounds will heal and your magic will replenish.
%%%%
faith mutation

You were embalmed with holy oils and sacred spices and bound about with blessed
cloth. Now you have a special connection with the divine, allowing you to gain
favour with your chosen god more quickly.
%%%%
devour on kill mutation

When you kill living creatures you have a chance to devour their life force
and restore health.
%%%%
rollpage mutation

You instinctively roll as you move toward enemies, rampaging forward an
additional space. This mutation grants magic regeneration when rolling; the
second level of this mutation regenerates both magic and health.
%%%%
double potion healing mutation

Whenever a potion restores your health or magic, it restores twice as much.
%%%%
drunken brawling mutation

Whenever you drink a potion that restores health or magic, you perform an
immediate attack against all enemies adjacent to you.

(This includes potions of curing, heal wounds, magic, and ambrosia.)
%%%%
artefact enchanting mutation

You can use scrolls of enchant weapon and armour upon random artefacts.

This cannot raise their enchantment above what would normally be possible on a
mundane item of the same type, and cannot affect especially unusual artefacts
at all.
%%%%
runic magic mutation

You cast spells with the assistance of glyphs marked upon your armour, greatly
reducing the complex movements which would otherwise be required.

(The encumbrance rating of all armour you wear is reduced by 1/2 for purposes
of spell success.)
%%%%
off-hand wielding mutation

You can wield a one-handed weapon in your off-hand, if not wielding a
two-handed weapon or wearing a shield or orb. You will follow up attacks from
your primary weapon with your off-hand weapon, with attack delay determined
by the average of the two. Ranged weapons can only follow attacks by ranged
weapons, and likewise melee weapons.
%%%%
slow wielding mutation

You must recalibrate your grasping arms when wielding or unwielding weapons.
This takes as long as donning armour.
%%%%
warmup strikes mutation

Your grasping arms need time to limber up, making your first few attacks in
each fight less effective. Slow, heavy attacks help more than fast attacks.
Both weapon-based and unarmed attacks are affected.
%%%%
no rings mutation

Your hands are embedded into the controls for your grasping arms, leaving you
with no place to wear magical rings without disastrous magical interference.
%%%%
iron-fused scales mutation

Your scales are fused with a thick layer of iron, giving them resilience akin to
a suit of armour (+5 AC).
%%%%
inviolate magic mutation

Your magic is resistant to distruption by outside forces. Hostile effects which
drain your MP drain only 1/3 as much and you are immune to having your magical
effects be removed by anyone but yourself.
%%%%
formless mutation

You have no physical body and instead interact with the world through haunting
objects. This allows you to 'equip' up to 6 boots, gloves, cloaks, or helmets in
any combination, but body armour is too large for you to usefully manipulate in
this fashion.

At higher levels, you can even send the armour you are haunting out to attack
enemies independently for short periods of time.
%%%%
trickster mutation

Your connection to the realm of the living grows stronger as you spread
misfortune.

Whenever you or your allies inflict new negative status effects upon nearby
enemies (other than poison), your AC temporarily increases. This bonus improves
with the number of different enemies affected, but will decay over time if you
do not continue to inflict new misfortune.

At your current XL, you can gain a maximum bonus of
{{return 6 + you.xl() * 4 / 5;}} AC this way.
%%%%
mnemnophage mutation

You devour the memories and even the very existence of those you kill, subsuming
them in the unholy fire that wreathes your body.

Once you have accumulated enough memories, you may choose to burn them all away
as fuel to greatly enhance your spellcasting for a short period of time.

At your current experience level, you can hold enough memories to cast a maximum
of {{return 3 + math.floor(you.xl() * 3 / 20);}} spells in a row this way.
%%%%
spellclaws mutation

You instinctually channel destructive magic through your claws. When casting a
damage-dealing spell, you also perform a melee attack against the most healthy
enemy in your attack range.

speed.

Your accursed nature makes it harder to dispel malignant energies from your
being, reducing the rate at which you can recover from Doom and Banes.
# ------ Fakemut descriptions ------
%%%%
vampire fangs mutation

When you perform a stab attack against a living monster with blood, you heal for
a portion of the total damage dealt. When you are at 50% of your max HP or less,
this has a chance to happen on all melee attacks which increases with your
Shapeshifting skill.
%%%%
bloodcurse mutation

When you kill a living monster with a stab attack, they may rise again to serve
you as a vampiric thrall. Thralls possess all the abilities they had in life,
but are undead, and gain a vampiric bite attack as well as increased melee
damage against sleeping foes. Spellcaster thralls will also gain knowledge of
the Vampiric Draining spell.

You can only create a thrall if you do not have one already, and they will
inevitably turn to dust after a short time.
%%%%
insubstantial mutation

You are insubstantial and immune to many effects that require a solid body. You
cannot be constricted, petrified, engulfed, skewered by barbs, covered in sticky
flame, or caught by webs, nets, or bolas.
%%%%
frigid aura mutation

Your breath radiates an intense chill which freezes nearby walls solid as you
fight.

Whenever you attack, you turn a random wall adjacent to your target or yourself
frigid. Frigid walls deal damage to any enemies adjacent to them each turn - up
to twice as much when an enemy is adjacent to as many as possible. This damage
increases with your shapeshifting skill.

The walls will rapidly melt again if you stop attacking.
%%%%
hive swarm mutation

Whenever an injury reduces your health to less than 50%, angry bees will swarm
out of your body to defend you.

This effect cannot happen again until your health is fully recovered.
%%%%
water reaching mutation

Your body is formed of elemental water that changes shape flexibly, allowing you
to reach and perform melee attacks from several tiles away - including auxiliary
attacks of all sorts.

The precision required to preform stab attacks is still impossible unless you're
adjacent to your target, and axes can only cleave to enemies adjacent to you,
regardless of where you strike.
%%%%
water splatter mutation

When injured, parts of your watery body may splatter as puddles of shallow
water nearby. The more damage you take at once, the more water is spread around.

%%%%
hex mastery mutation

Your Hexes spells are much easier to cast (reduced miscast chance and severity)
and enemies have reduced willpower against all your effects.

again, these may confuse or vex them, but mostly they just attract their
attention.
%%%%
werefury mutation

bonus that increases with your Shapeshifting skill.

This bonus stacks up to +12 and will not expire so long as you continue to
perform melee attacks.

When you kill an enemy in melee, if your werefury bonus is at least 5, you may
unleash a terrifying howl that attempts to freeze all nearby enemies in place
with fear if it overcomes their willpower.

Your hair is made of long prehensile jellyfish-like tendrils. Whenever you
attack in melee, they will lash out and attempt to poison several visible
enemies within 2 tiles of the player at random.

The number of enemies they can afflict at once is improved by Shapeshifting
skill.
%%%%
lithotoxin mutation

When your health drops to 60% of your max HP or less, your tendrils reflexively
attempt to petrify all poisoned enemies within 3 tiles of you.

This effect cannot activate again until you fully heal and its success chance
improves with your Shapeshifting skill.
%%%%
contaminating mutation

When you strike an enemy in melee, a portion of the transmutational energy
surging through will contaminate them. Upon landing the third strike in a row,
this contamination will grow so acute that it will twist their bodily form,
inflicting significant AC-ignoring damage and malmutating them.

enemies, a random servant may gain one of: Haste, Might, Regeneration, or
Brilliance.
%%%%
Mark of Carnage mutation

Your Infernal Servants are now summoned adjacent to a random enemy instead of
near you. When they appear, they do so in a blast of your characteristic
Destruction (which cannot hurt you or other allies).

%%%%
Mark of the Legion mutation

Your Infernal Servant ability is replaced with Infernal Legion, allowing you to
call in a small army of demons over time. While individually short-lived, their
numbers are inexhaustible for as long as the status lasts, and they will never
be hostile to you.

You may also unleash Makhleb's Destruction through your summoned allies without
harming them.
%%%%
Mark of Annihilation mutation

Your Infernal Servant ability is replaced with Globe of Annihilation, allowing
you to hurl slow-moving spheres of intense destructive force that detonate

gore, which damages adjacent foes proportional to the victim's maximum health.

Enemies who die to this explosion will always explode themselves.
%%%%
Mark of the Celebrant mutation

Whenever you fall below 50% of your maximum HP, you perform an infernal rite,
unleashing a flurry of blood arrows aimed at nearby enemies. You will fire at
least one arrow for every valid target, but may fire additional ones if few are
present. Invocations increases the damage of these arrows, and Makhleb will
always bestow healing upon you for enemies killed by them.

After performing a blood rite, you cannot perform another until your HP has
fully recovered.
%%%%
Mark of Execution mutation

A demonic incarnation of murder lies dormant within your soul. Whenever you kill
an enemy in melee, there is a small chance for it to awaken and manifest as a
maelstrom of scythe-like blades enveloping you. These blades will attack
whenever you do and also retaliate whenever you successfully dodge an enemy
attack.

You have the ability to rampage swiftly towards enemies while possessed, but if
you spend more than a short while doing anything other than attacking, the
demonic presence will go dormant inside you once again.
%%%%
Mark of Atrocity mutation

Your Unleash Destruction is empowered the more times you use it consecutively
without pause, increasing in both damage and health cost. Upon using it a fourth
time in a row, you will automatically unleash a wild barrage of additional bolts
aimed at random targets and reset this boost.
%%%%
Mark of the Fanatic mutation

Grants you the Vessel of Slaughter ability, allowing you to transform into a
powerful demonic avatar with greatly boosted offence and defence for a short
period of time, in exchange for being dragged down into the Crucible of Flesh
afterward and made to fight for your freedom.
%%%%

any means. Simplistic, unthinking magical constructs, such as spectral weapons,
orbs of destruction, and battlespheres, are unaffected.
