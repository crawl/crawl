user becomes unable to cast spells.
%%%%

Remove all of your blood, transitioning to a bloodless state.
%%%%
Revivify ability

Return to life, transitioning from bloodless to alive. This process renders
the user temporarily frail.
%%%%
Hurl Damnation ability

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation. These unholy forces harm the victim and
anyone adjacent, and are not affected by any means of protection, such as armour
or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke
damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Word of Chaos ability

Speaks a word of chaos, forcing enemies nearby to blink away from the user.
Additionally, those affected may be slowed, ensnared, or terrified by the
experience. Invoking a word of chaos is no easy feat and will drain the user's
maximum health somewhat, and the ability then cannot be used again for a short
time.
%%%%
Heal Wounds ability

Heals the user significantly, with a chance of permanently reducing the user's
maximum magic capacity by one.
%%%%
Dig ability

Allows making tunnels through soft rock and rusted grates. Activating the
ability has no cost and simply prepares you to start digging; once active,
moving into a wall will start tunnelling. Doing so makes some noise and drains
the user's maximum health.

Once active, activating the ability again or making any non-digging movement
action will cancel the Dig status.
%%%%
Shaft Self ability

Sends you to a random position one to three floors down, as if you jumped into
a shaft trap. It takes some time to dig the shaft.
%%%%

Randomly translocates the user a short distance. Translocating in this way
destabilises the user temporarily, preventing consecutive blinks for a
short period of time depending on Evocations skill.
%%%%

%%%%
# Zin
Recite ability

Preaches to nearby monsters about Zin's laws for a short duration. After
finishing a recitation, it cannot be repeated for a short time.

The recitation will have different effects depending on the target: the chaotic
and unclean will be affected by powerful and damaging effects, undead and
demons will be affected by weaker rebukes, and any other intelligent creatures
will have confusion sown amongst them, with heretics and priests of gods other
than Zin being punished much more strongly. The effectiveness of the recitation
is increased by Invocations skill and piety.
%%%%
Vitalisation ability

Temporarily provides protection from poison, confusion, petrification, and
sickness, as well as the effects of clouds of foul pestilence. Your strength,
intelligence and dexterity are also temporarily increased by a degree dependent

once should you breach the divine peace.
%%%%

%%%%
# The Shining One
Divine Shield ability

a normal, physical shield. The strength and duration of the shield are increased
by Invocations skill.

Invokes a huge blast of divine fury centered on the user, severely damaging
undead and demons and dealing damage to all other hostile creatures. The power
of the blast is increased by Invocations skill.

One. Demon weapons will be converted into a more powerful sacred weapon. This
blessing may only be used once, and it cannot be used on artefact weapons.

fodder for all kinds of necromancy. Their number and quality is dependent on
Necromancy skill.
%%%%

pain some poor soul suffered in its entire life. This damage is never directly
lethal. Kikubaaqudgha will always at least partially shield you from the effect.
%%%%

abilities it had in life.

Living, holy and demonic monsters can be targeted (excepting most lords of
Pandemonium), as long as they are relatively uninjured. The duration of the mark
is dependent on Invocations skill.

The bound soul will follow its captor through stairs, and can be recalled from

# Trog
Berserk ability

Sends the user into a berserk rage. Going berserk temporarily increases health,
speed, and damage dealt in melee. It will time out quickly outside of combat,
but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, almost all actions other
than movement and melee combat are prevented. When the rage expires, the user
will be slowed and unable to berserk again for a short time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand ability

is effective even on those who would not otherwise be able to regenerate. It
also fortifies the user's willpower, protecting against many magical effects.
%%%%

%%%%
# Elyvilon
Purification ability

Purges your body of poison, confusion, slowness, petrification, weakness, and
sickness. Any drained strength, dexterity or intelligence will also be fully
restored, along with any drained maximum health.
%%%%
Heal Other ability

Heals a creature other than yourself by a moderate amount, depending on
Invocations skill. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to turn them
neutral. This works best on living creatures, with the undead and demons being
progressively harder to pacify. Intelligent creatures are also more difficult
to pacify.

Ghosts of dead adventurers and demon lords are too wrathful to be pacified,
mindless creatures are too unintelligent to be pacified, and no monster can be
pacified while it is asleep.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested piety and magic points
are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain the monster's
full experience value. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you gain
nothing.
%%%%
Heal Self ability

Heals a moderate amount of health, depending on Invocations skill.
%%%%

some piety and the creature's full experience value. Invocations skill makes it
harder to resist.
%%%%
Corrupt ability

Corrupts the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will
cause the area nearby to change appearance, and will gate in creatures from the
Abyss bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already
corrupted or in the Abyss itself. The size of the effect is increased by
Invocations skill.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss ability

Transports you to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health depleted.
%%%%

well as the damage of its exploding spores.
%%%%

indifferent if they have not become your allies.

said god).
%%%%
Convert to Beogh ability

combat accuracy and damage are substantially increased, and striking enemies
with martial attacks increases this bonus. The storm weakens over time and
fades away once the bonus reaches zero. The heavenly clouds prevent
invisibility, and obscure the vision of those outside the storm.
%%%%
Fiery Armour ability

Armour yourself in fire, providing +7 AC and searing foes foolish enough to
strike you in melee. The fire takes quite a long time to burn out.

Asmodeus.
%%%%
Evoke the Staff of Dispater ability

ability scales with the Evocations skill, and this ability is available only
while wielding the Staff of Dispater.
%%%%
