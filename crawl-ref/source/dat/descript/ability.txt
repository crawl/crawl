%%%%
Breathe Lightning ability

Release a great discharge of electricity causing an uncontrollable lightning

%%%%
Breathe Steam ability

Breathe a jet of steam at a targeted monster.
%%%%
Breathe Noxious Fumes ability

Breathe a blast of noxious fumes at a targeted monster.
%%%%
Bat Form ability

Turn into a speedy vampire bat. In bat form, you can neither interact with
items in any form (except picking them up or dropping them), nor cast spells.

Dexterity. Thus, you won't be able to change form if your Strength is too low.

and blood-containing corpses they are standing on.
%%%%

Be warned, though, that flight may time out at inopportune moments and cause
you to fall to your death.
%%%%
Hellfire ability

Blast your enemies with hellfire. This ball of unholy flames explodes on
impact, and is not affected by any means of protection such as armour or
resistances. However, certain creatures, usually fire-based, are immune to
hellfire entirely.

cost in terms of magic or hunger.

Intelligence, and heal any rotted health.
%%%%
Device Recharging ability

At the permanent loss of one magic point recharge a wand or rod.
%%%%
Dig ability

Allows making tunnels through soft rock and rusted grates. Using this ability
merely states your intent to dig; to actually tunnel you need to move into a
wall. Doing so is a little slower than walking, creates some noise and causes
hunger.
%%%%
Shaft Self ability

Sends you to a random position one to three floors down, as if you jumped into
a shaft trap. It takes some time to dig the shaft.
%%%%
Evoke Teleportation ability

Teleport yourself to a random location on the level.
%%%%
Evoke Blink ability

<Blink ability>
%%%%
Evoke Berserk Rage ability

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your health and
damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill
anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot
perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff
something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually
followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, cannot
berserk again, and occasionally even pass out.
%%%%
Evoke Invisibility ability

Turn yourself invisible for a limited amount of time. Turning invisible
increases your magical contamination and may eventually cause glowing.

Gain the ability to control your next translocation – either by selecting an
approximate target for a teleport, or by selecting a direction for a blink. Be
wary that controlled translocations will cause the subject to become
contaminated with magical energy, and that controlled teleports will take
longer to trigger than uncontrolled ones.
%%%%
End Transformation ability

Revert to your normal form, with a short delay.
%%%%
# Zin
Recite ability

Preach to monsters about Zin's laws, which can lead to various results. The
recitation will continue for a short while, but will be interrupted by actions
such as spellcasting, reading scrolls or quaffing potions. There are four books
you can preach from:
 • Book of Abominations: This book deals with the thing most abhorrent to Zin —
chaos in all its forms. These recitations will invoke Zin's most powerful
smiting.
 • Book of Ablutions: The impure are nearly as loathed by the Law-Giver.
Recitations from this book will deal damage to such creatures.
 • Book of Apostates: Recitations from this book will sow confusion amongst
intelligent creatures. Those who dare to worship a god other than Zin may be
permanently deprived of means to spread their foul faith.
 • Book of Anathema: Demons and the undead are hated by Zin. This book gives
you means to rebuke them.
%%%%
Vitalisation ability

Vitalise yourself, gaining divine stamina and sustenance from Zin. Divine
stamina protects you from sickness, poisoning, petrification, confusion and
rot, and temporarily boosts and sustains your Strength, Intelligence and
Dexterity.
%%%%
Imprison ability

Temporarily imprison a monster in walls of silver. The duration of the prison
is increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Sanctuary ability

For a short duration gain safety in a divine refuge. While you are inside the
sanctuary, monsters will not attack you, but the protection will disappear at
once should you breach the divine peace.
%%%%
Cure All Mutations ability

Cure all your mutations — but only once.
%%%%
# The Shining One
Divine Shield ability

The Shining One grants you a divine shield. Because it is held aloft by godly
power, it does not interfere with your equipment. The strength and duration
of the shield are increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame ability

Invoke a huge blast of divine fury centered on you, severely damaging undead
and demons. All other hostiles also take damage, if less so, whereas you and
your allies are never affected.
%%%%
Summon Divine Warrior ability

Summon an angel or daeva, powerful warriors against evil. They may be blessed
by the Shining One to stay longer in this world.
%%%%
# Kikubaaqudgha
Receive Corpses ability

Create one or more reanimatable monster corpses near yourself. The number and
freshness of these are dependent on Necromancy skill.
%%%%
Torment ability

Sacrifice a cadaver to make everyone in sight, including you, experience all
the pain that being suffered in its life. This will decimate the resilience of
all those who can feel it.

Kikubaaqudgha may choose to protect you from it... or may not.
%%%%
# Yredelemnul
Animate Remains ability

Reanimate a single corpse or skeleton as a follower. Note that zombies and
skeletons cannot leave the level they were created on.
%%%%
Recall Undead Slaves ability

Recall your undead followers from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate
surroundings.
%%%%
Injury Mirror ability

Hurt attacking monsters by reflecting damage they do to you back at them,
reducing piety depending on the amount of damage that is reflected.
%%%%
Animate Dead ability

Reanimate all corpses and skeletons in your vicinity as followers. Note that
zombies and skeletons cannot leave the level they were created on.
%%%%
Drain Life ability

Heal by draining the life force of the monsters surrounding you.
%%%%
Enslave Soul ability

Mark a living intelligent monster's soul as ripe for the taking. Once the
marked monster dies, its soul will be yours.

The enslaved soul will retain the monster's faculties, equipment and abilities,
as well as some of its innate healing. However, only a relatively uninjured
monster can have its soul marked, and only one soul can be enslaved at a time.
Furthermore, the duration of the mark is dependent on Invocations skill.

Note that enslaved souls can follow you beyond the level they were created on.
%%%%
Animate Remains or Dead ability

If you get this description, it is a bug.
%%%%
# Okawaru
Heroism ability

Temporarily increase all of your combat skills, including the ability to sneak
around.
%%%%
Finesse ability

Greatly increase your combat speed, with no loss of accuracy. This unnatural
effect causes small amounts of magic contamination, prolonged exposure to which
may be bad for your health.
%%%%
# Makhleb
Minor Destruction ability

Shoot a random harmful blast at the targeted monster.
%%%%
Lesser Servant of Makhleb ability

Summon a minor demon. High Invocations skill reduces the chance of it being
hostile.
%%%%

%%%%

Channel Energy ability

skill.
%%%%
Forget Spell ability

Forget any spell out of the ones you've currently memorised, so as to free
memory to learn others.
%%%%
# Trog
Burn Spellbooks ability

Set all spellbooks within your field of vision on fire. The fire is fuelled by
Trog's hatred, and it burns hotter than mere parchment would — which can be
useful if you throw the book under someone's feet first. Obviously, Trog
greatly appreciates using this ability.
%%%%
Berserk ability

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your health and
damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill
anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot
perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff
something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually
followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, and
cannot berserk again. Unlike other sources of rage, depending on your piety
Trog may occasionally prevent you from passing out.
%%%%
Trog's Hand ability

Invoke a powerful regeneration ability which stacks with all other sources and
even allows otherwise non-healing species to regenerate. While active, you will
also be granted powerful protection from hostile enchantments.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms ability

Summon huge angry allies to wreak havoc.
%%%%
# Elyvilon
Divine Protection ability

Beseech Elyvilon to save your life. If you are mortally wounded, the Healer may
undo the killing blow. Especially pious individuals may be certain of this
help, but in that case, any actual intervention costs piety (as opposed to
merely asking for intervention, which is always free).

Beware: killing others while asking to be spared yourself is a major sin!
%%%%
Lesser Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a small
amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them neutral.
This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still worse on
other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless creatures
cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is asleep. The
chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food and magic are lost.
If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half the monster's
experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected
and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Lesser Self-Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a small amount of health.
%%%%
Purification ability

Purge your body of all bad effects such as sickness, poisoning, slowness,
petrification, confusion and rot, and fully restore your Strength, Dexterity
and Intelligence.
%%%%
Greater Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a
moderate amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them
neutral. This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still
worse on other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless
creatures cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is
asleep. The chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power, so
it is significantly better than using Lesser Healing.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food, piety and magic
points are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half
the monster's experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster
is unaffected and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Greater Self-Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a moderate amount of health.
Roughly, Greater Healing will allow you to heal three times the amount of
Lesser Healing at a slightly higher total piety cost.
%%%%
Divine Vigour ability

Greatly increase your maximum health and magic points, depending on
Invocations skill. Your current health and magic points will also be
increased proportionally.
%%%%
# Lugonu
Depart the Abyss ability

Leave the Abyss to return to the place you came from.
%%%%
Bend Space ability

Bend the fabric of space around you, instantly translocating you a small
distance, and possibly also translocating and damaging monsters in your
vicinity. In warping the fabric of space, this ability ignores effects that
would usually prevent translocations.
%%%%
Banish ability

Attempt to banish a monster into the Abyss.
%%%%
Corrupt ability

Corrupt the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will cause
the level to largely change appearance, and will gate in demons from the Abyss
bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already corrupted or
in the Abyss.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss ability

Transfer yourself to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health and magic depleted.
%%%%
# Nemelex Xobeh
Triple Draw ability

Draw three cards from any deck in your inventory, look at them, and decide
which one to keep, discarding the other two.
%%%%
Deal Four ability

Deal four cards from any unmarked deck in the time it normally takes to draw a
single card. The rest of the deck is lost. If the deck does not contain enough
cards, Nemelex will give you one extra card, but you might not like it.
%%%%
Stack Five ability

Draw five cards from any unmarked deck in your inventory, losing the rest of
the deck. Look at the cards and sort them into any order you'd like.
Subsequently, you can draw these cards in the order you chose.
%%%%
# Beogh
Smiting ability

Smite an enemy within your field of vision. This doesn't require a direct path,
just seeing the enemy is enough.
%%%%
Recall Orcish Followers ability

Recall your orcish followers from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate
surroundings.
%%%%
Stop Recall ability

Stop recalling your followers.
%%%%
Give Item to Named Follower ability

Give a weapon or piece of armour to a named orcish follower. An orc can only

%%%%
# Fedhas
Sunlight ability

Call sunlight down over a small area of the dungeon. Monsters illuminated by
the light will be easier to hit. Water affected by the sunlight will evaporate.
In particular, deep water will become shallow water, and shallow water will dry
up completely, revealing the dungeon floor.
%%%%
Growth ability

Use fruit to grow a ring of plants around yourself. If a complete ring cannot
be formed (because you do not have enough fruit), plants will grow on squares
adjacent to you that are close to monsters. The plants you create gain bonus
health proportional to your Invocations skill.
%%%%
Rain ability

Cause rain to fall around yourself, turning the dungeon floor into shallow
water and shallow water into deep water. This is likely to allow plants and
mushrooms to grow in areas not directly drenched.
%%%%
Reproduction ability

Create giant spores from corpses in your line of sight. The spores will
explode, causing damage to you or your enemies.
%%%%
Evolution ability

Turn plants and fungi into stronger species. Upgrading fungi requires piety,
while upgrading plants requires fruit. Upgraded plants gain a bonus to attack
accuracy proportional to the user's Invocations skill, and oklob plants are
more likely to spit acid at higher Invocations.
%%%%
# Cheibriados
Bend Time ability

Attempt to slow down everyone adjacent to you. High Invocations skill makes it
harder to resist.
%%%%
Temporal Distortion ability

Warp the flow of time around you, causing monsters to skip forwards in time
relative to you.
%%%%
Slouch ability

Cause damage to everyone in sight who is moving faster than you, dealing more
damage with greater differences in speed.
%%%%
Step From Time ability

Remove yourself from the flow of time. Things around you will happen at their
usual busy pace, monsters will wander, perishable items will decay, plants will
grow. After some time has passed, you will return in the same state as the very
second you departed.
%%%%
# Jiyva
Request Jelly ability

Create a neutral jelly that will wander the floor and digest items.
%%%%

corporeal undead monster hit into a neutral slime.
%%%%
Cure Bad Mutation ability

Remove a randomly selected bad mutation.
%%%%

spells and abilities, even those that work through glass.
%%%%
Transfer Knowledge ability

Sacrifice part of one of your skills to improve another.
%%%%
End Transfer Knowledge ability

Abort an ongoing skill transfer.
%%%%
# Dithmenos
Shadow Step ability

If a creature within your umbra is still enough for you to focus on its shadow,
this ability allows you to step through that shadow to immediately be placed
adjacent to that creature.
%%%%
Shadow Form ability

This invocation transforms you into a swirling mass of dark shadows. While in
this form, you are permanently invisible and are immune to poison, draining,
torment, and hostile enchantments. All incoming damage will be halved, and you
will bleed smoke on any incoming attack. However, your ability to deal damage
in melee will be halved, your spellcasting power will be greatly hampered, and
your skills will be further drained when taking damage.
%%%%
# Gozag
Potion Petition ability

Petition Gozag to sell you the effects of a set of potions. Gozag will offer
four lists at a time, with varying prices. One of the potion sets will always
solely consist of a potion of porridge, which will always be affordable if the
ability is usable. Prices will slowly increase as you purchase potions.
%%%%
Call Merchant ability

Through Gozag, send funds to a merchant to help them set up shop in the
dungeon. The shop may appear in an unvisited area of the dungeon, or near your
location if there are no other appropriate locations for a store. The cost of
funding a shop increases with the number of shops funded.
%%%%
Bribe Branch ability

Give 3000 gold to Gozag to spread throughout the inhabitants of the current
branch, only possible if the branch has intelligent native monsters. Those
native to a bribed branch will occasionally become uninterested in fighting you
(with tougher inhabitants having an increasing chance of being bribed), and
more rarely will join your ranks. Enemies become less hostile will lower the
remaining bribe fund; upon its exhaustion, bribed enemies will resume
hostilities.
%%%%
# Qazlal
Upheaval ability

Calls on the forces of nature to blast a small area with magma, ice, wind,
or rubble.
%%%%
Elemental Force ability

%%%%
# Ru
Draw Out Power ability

Tap into your inner power to restore health and magic, as well as freeing your
body and mind from external constraints, including nets, webs, constriction,
petrification, slowness, and confusion. The amount of health and magic restored
increases with piety.

Using this ability exhausts and slightly drains you.
%%%%
Power Leap ability

Use the power that infuses you to perform an incredibly fast leap. On landing,
that power explodes outward, damaging everything adjacent to you. The amount of
damage done increases with your piety and experience level.

Using this ability exhausts you.
%%%%
Apocalypse ability

You reveal Ru's truth to your enemies. All enemies in your line of sight are
dealt severe damage and may be rendered mute or paralyzed or slowed. The damage
dealt by this power increases with your piety and experience level.

Using this ability exhausts and severely drains you.
%%%%
Sacrifice Purity ability

Adherents who choose to sacrifice their purity will be offered a single
mutation. The mutation can be one of deterioration, deformed body, uncontrolled
shouting, worse device healing, clumsiness, weakness or dopiness.

If you make this sacrifice, your powers granted by Ru will become stronger in
proportion to the value of the sacrifice, and you may gain new powers as well.

Sacrifices cannot be taken back.
%%%%
Sacrifice Words ability

Adherents who choose to sacrifice their words lose the ability to use magical

%%%%
Sacrifice Artifice ability

magical objects and their Evocations skill is set to 0.

Sacrifices cannot be taken back.
%%%%
Sacrifice Love ability

Adherents who choose to sacrifice love are despised by all. All creatures,
even those summoned by the adherent, become hostile.

If you make this sacrifice, your powers granted by Ru will become stronger in
proportion to the value of the sacrifice, and you may gain new powers as well.

Sacrifices cannot be taken back.
%%%%
Sacrifice Courage ability

Adherents who choose to sacrifice their courage become terrified of dangerous
monsters. Such monsters fill them with horror, which reduces the adherents'
ability to hit and damage monsters in combat, and the power of the adherents'
spells.

If you make this sacrifice, your powers granted by Ru will become stronger in
proportion to the value of the sacrifice, and you may gain new powers as well.

Sacrifices cannot be taken back.

proportion to the value of the sacrifice, and you may gain new powers as well.

Sacrifices cannot be taken back.
%%%%
Reject Sacrifices ability

Adherents who cannot bring themselves to make any offered sacrifice may reject
the offers. Doing so means Ru will take more time evaluating the adherent's
readiness for future sacrifices. Ru will not offer more sacrifices while there
is an existing offer still extended.

Each consecutive rejection increases the sacrifice timer significantly.
Accepting a sacrifice will reset the timer to the standard length.
%%%%
Renounce Religion ability

Renounce your faith. This will make your character leave your god (and usually
anger said god).
%%%%
Convert to Beogh ability

Swear your fealty to Beogh, the god of cave orcs. This god demands that all
non-believers must die, but new believers must be spared and accepted into the
fold. Beware, for orcs who haven't seen you convert may still be hostile until
you've built your reputation!

All other gods hate Beogh, and don't take desertion lightly.
