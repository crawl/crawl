While berserk, you cannot perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, cannot berserk again, and occasionally even pass out.

Enslave Soul

Mark a monster's living soul as ripe for the taking. Once the marked monster dies, its soul will be yours.

The soul will retain at least some of the monster's innate healing ability and faculties, and sometimes even the monster's equipment. However, only a relatively uninjured monster can have its soul marked, and only one soul can be enslaved at a time. Furthermore, both the duration of the mark and the chance that the enslaved soul will remain intact are dependent on Invocations skill.

Note that enslaved souls, whether twisted or intact, can follow you beyond the level they were created on.
%%%%

%%%%
Berserk

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your hit points and damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, and cannot berserk again. Unlike other sources of rage, depending on your piety Trog may occasionally prevent you from passing out.
%%%%
Trog's Hand

Invoke a powerful regeneration ability which stacks with all other sources and even allows otherwise non-healing species to regenerate. This will also increase protection from magical effects.
%%%%

%%%%
# Elyvilon
Destroy Weapons

Destroy all weapons on the ground. In order to prevent a weapon from being accidentally destroyed, use the !D inscription.
%%%%
Lesser Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a small amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them neutral. This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still worse on other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. The chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food and magic point are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half the monster's experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Lesser Self-Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a small amount of hit points.
%%%%
Purification

Purge your body of bad effects such as sickness, poisoning, slowness, confusion and rotting.
%%%%
Greater Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a moderate amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them neutral. This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still worse on other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. The chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power, so it is significantly better than using Lesser Healing.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food, piety and magic points are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half the monster's experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Greater Self-Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a moderate amount of hit points. Roughly, Greater Healing will allow you to heal three times the amount of Lesser Healing at a slightly higher total piety cost.
%%%%
Restoration

Fully restore your Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence, and heal a large amount of rotted hit points.
%%%%
Divine Vigour

Depending on your Invocations skill, restore a large amount of, and temporarily increase, both your hit points and your magic points.

# Fedhas
Decomposition

Cause corpses in your field of vision to rapidly decay. Corpses with a monster on top of them will not be affected.

Sunlight

%%%%
Growth

Use fruit to grow a ring of plants around yourself. If a complete ring cannot be formed (because you do not have enough fruit), plants will grow on squares adjacent to you that are close to monsters. The plants you create gain bonus HP proportional to your invocations skill.
%%%%

%%%%
Reproduction

%%%%
Slouch

Cause damage to everyone in sight who is moving faster than you. Those magically hasted will be hurt particularly painfully.
