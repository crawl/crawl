%%%%

%%%%
Bat Form ability

Transforms the user into a swift-moving vampire bat, increasing evasion but
substantially weakening melee attacks. The transformation drains the user's
attributes.

user becomes unable to cast spells.
%%%%
Exsanguinate ability

Remove all of your blood, transitioning to a bloodless state.
%%%%
Revivify ability

Return to life, transitioning from bloodless to alive. This process renders
the user temporarily frail.
%%%%
Hurl Damnation ability

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation. These unholy forces harm the victim and
anyone adjacent, and are not affected by any means of protection, such as armour
or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke
damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Word of Chaos ability

Speaks a word of chaos, forcing enemies nearby to blink away from the user.
Additionally, those affected may be slowed, ensnared, or terrified by the
experience. Invoking a word of chaos is no easy feat and will drain the user's
maximum health somewhat, and the ability then cannot be used again for a short
time.
%%%%
Heal Wounds ability

Heals the user significantly, with a chance of permanently reducing the user's
maximum magic capacity by one.
%%%%
Dig ability

Allows making tunnels through soft rock and rusted grates. Activating the
ability has no cost and simply prepares you to start digging; once active,
moving into a wall will start tunneling. Doing so makes some noise and is a
little slower than walking.

Once active, activating the ability again or making any non-digging movement
action will cancel the Dig status.
%%%%
Shaft Self ability

Sends you to a random position one to three floors down, as if you jumped into
a shaft trap. It takes some time to dig the shaft.
%%%%
Rolling Charge ability

Rolls at a foe with a clatter of scales, then uncurls and strikes them in melee
with increased accuracy. The greater the distance of the roll, the more
momentum will be added to the force of your strike. You roll with sufficient
speed to dodge traps and harmful terrain along the way, but not at your
destination.
%%%%
Evoke Blink ability

Randomly translocates the user a short distance.
%%%%
Evoke Berserk Rage ability

<Berserk ability>

%%%%
End Transformation ability

Reverts you to your normal form.
%%%%
# Zin
Recite ability

Preaches to nearby monsters about Zin's laws for a short duration. After
finishing a recitation, it cannot be repeated for a short time.

The recitation will have different effects depending on the target: the chaotic
and unclean will be affected by powerful and damaging effects, undead and
demons will be affected by weaker rebukes, and any other intelligent creatures
will have confusion sown amongst them, with heretics and priests of gods other
than Zin being punished much more strongly. The effectiveness of the recitation
is increased by Invocations skill and piety.
%%%%
Vitalisation ability

Temporarily provides protection from poison, confusion, petrification, and
sickness, and increases and sustains your strength, intelligence and dexterity.
The increases to your attributes are determined by Invocations skill.
%%%%

is increased by Invocations skill.

once should you breach the divine peace.
%%%%
Cure All Mutations ability

Cures all your mutations — but only once.
%%%%
# The Shining One
Divine Shield ability

power, it does not interfere with your equipment, but it functions otherwise as
a normal, physical shield. The strength and duration of the shield are increased
by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame ability

Invokes a huge blast of divine fury centered on the user, severely damaging
undead and demons and dealing damage to all other hostile creatures. The power
of the blast is increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%

duration of their assistance is increased by Invocations skill, and glory in
battle may lead the Shining One to bless them with an even longer stay.

One. Demon weapons will be converted into a more powerful sacred weapon. This
blessing may only be used once, and it cannot be used on artefact weapons.

freshness of these are dependent on Necromancy skill.

the pain that being suffered in its life. This damage is never directly lethal.
Kikubaaqudgha may shield you from the effect, depending on your piety.

itself. This blessing cannot be used on artefact weapons. You must choose
between this gift or that of the Necronomicon, and either gift may only be

%%%%

%%%%
Enslave Soul ability

Marks a monster's soul as ripe for the taking. Intelligent living, holy and
demonic monsters can be targeted (excepting most lords of Pandemonium), as
long as they are relatively uninjured. The duration of the mark is dependent on
Invocations skill. If the monster dies while still marked, its soul will become
yours.

The enslaved soul will retain the monster's faculties, equipment and abilities,
as well as some of its innate healing. However, only one soul can be enslaved
at a time.

%%%%
# Trog
Berserk ability

Sends the user into a berserk rage. Going berserk temporarily increases health,
speed, and damage dealt in melee. It will time out quickly outside of combat,
but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, almost all actions other
than movement and melee combat are prevented. When the rage expires, the user
will be briefly slowed and occasionally may even pass out, and will be unable
to berserk again for a short time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand ability

Invokes a powerful regeneration ability which stacks with all other sources and
is effective even on those who would not otherwise be able to regenerate. It
also fortifies the user's willpower, protecting against many magical effects.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms ability

Summons huge angry allies to wreak havoc.
%%%%
# Elyvilon
Divine Protection ability

Beseeches Elyvilon to save your life. If you are mortally wounded, the Healer
may undo the killing blow. Especially pious individuals may be certain of this
help, but in that case, any intervention costs piety (as opposed to merely
asking for intervention, which is always free). Killing others while asking
for divine protection will cause penance.
%%%%
Lesser Healing ability

Heals a small amount of health, depending on Invocations skill.
%%%%
Purification ability

Purges your body of poison, confusion, slowness, petrification, weakness, and
sickness. Any drained strength, dexterity or intelligence will also be fully
restored, along with any drained maximum health.
%%%%
Heal Other ability

Heals a creature other than yourself by a moderate amount, depending on
Invocations skill. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to turn them
neutral. This works best on animals, and is less effective on humanoids and
other intelligent creatures. Undead and demons are harder still to pacify.
Plants do not respond to the healing arts and cannot be pacified.
Ghosts of dead adventurers and demon lords are too wrathful to be pacified,
mindless creatures are too unintelligent to be pacified, and no monster can be
pacified while it is asleep.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested piety and magic
points are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half
the monster's experience value. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you
gain nothing.
%%%%
Greater Healing ability

Heals a moderate amount of health, depending on Invocations skill. Greater
Healing will heal approximately three times as much as Lesser Healing, but at a
slightly higher total piety cost.
%%%%
Divine Vigour ability

Greatly increases your maximum health and magic points, depending on
Invocations skill. Your current health and magic points will also be increased
proportionally.
%%%%
# Lugonu

Transports you out of the Abyss, returning you to the location from which you
entered it.
%%%%
Bend Space ability

Bends the fabric of space, instantly translocating the user a short distance,
and possibly also translocating and damaging other adjacent creatures. In
warping the fabric of space, this ability ignores effects that would usually
prevent translocations. Invocations skill increases the chance of affecting
nearby creatures and the damage dealt to those affected.
%%%%
Banish ability

Attempts to banish a creature into the Abyss. If the attempt succeeds, you gain
some piety and the creature's full experience value. Invocations skill makes it
harder to resist.
%%%%
Corrupt ability

Corrupts the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will
cause the area nearby to change appearance, and will gate in creatures from the
Abyss bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already
corrupted or in the Abyss itself. The size of the effect is increased by
Invocations skill.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss ability

Transports you to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health depleted.
%%%%
Brand Weapon With Distortion ability

Permanently corrupts a weapon of your choice with a localized field of
distortion. This blessing may only be used once, and it cannot be used on
artefact weapons.

Invocations skill increases the health and duration of the ballistomycete as
well as the damage of its exploding spores.
%%%%
Overgrow ability

Permanently destroy a wall-like structure, growing a short-lived plant ally in

while you're gone.

hampered, and your maximum health is further drained when taking damage.

funding a shop increases with the number of shops funded.
%%%%
Bribe Branch ability

Gives 3000 gold to Gozag to spread throughout the inhabitants of the current
branch, only possible if the branch has intelligent inhabitants. Those monsters
may then become uninterested in fighting you (with tougher inhabitants having
an increasing chance of being bribed), and more rarely will join your ranks,
though they will not leave their home branch. Enemies accepting a bribe will
lower the remaining bribe fund; upon its exhaustion, bribed enemies will become
indifferent if they have not become your allies.
%%%%
# Pakellas
Device Surge ability

Readies a device surge, which triggers on your next usage of a magical device
to strengthen its power at the cost of some magic. The amount of magical power
that can be used for a surge varies, but correlates with how devoted a follower
is to Pakellas.
%%%%

such as orbs of destruction and spectral weapons, are the only things which can

monsters fill you with horror, which reduces the power of your spells and your

magic and preventing you from having any ranks in those skills.

said god).
%%%%
Convert to Beogh ability

overall increase is determined by the size of your donation.
%%%%
Recall Ancestor ability

Recalls your ancestor from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate

Invocations skill.
%%%%

Allows you to move at supernatural speeds, making any normal movements up to a
distance of two tiles instant. Martial attacks performed under the effect of
Serpent's Lash are more damaging and never miss.
%%%%
Heavenly Storm ability

Invokes a storm of heavenly clouds. While the storm rages, your evasion and
combat accuracy and damage are substantially increased, and striking enemies
with martial attacks increases this bonus. The storm weakens over time and
fades away once the bonus reaches zero. The heavenly clouds prevent
invisibility, and obscure the vision of those outside the storm.
%%%%
Hop ability

Hops toward a chosen destination, landing somewhere nearby. After using this
ability, you will be unable to hop again until you have spent some time not
moving. (Other actions, such as casting spells and attacking, are fine.)
