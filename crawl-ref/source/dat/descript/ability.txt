If you get this description, it is a bug.
%%%%

%%%%

they touch. It is harmless to its user.

Glacial Breath ability

Exhales a powerful wave of frost which encases anything it kills in a solid
block of durable ice.
%%%%
Nullifying Breath ability

Breathes a large blast of pure antimagic that dispels magical effects from

cast spells for a while. It is harmless to its user.
%%%%

sight-obscuring steam clouds in its wake.
%%%%
Galvanic Breath ability

Exhales a charged burst of electricity that will arc through a target and every
other creature that is connected to it.
%%%%

surrounding area in a mud slick which impedes enemy movement and causes them to
sometimes fumble their attacks.
%%%%
Caustic Breath ability

Breathes a spray of concentrated acid which leaves corrosive clouds on any
unoccupied tiles it passes over and corrodes whatever it hits.
%%%%
Noxious Breath ability

Breathe Poison Gas ability

Breathes a blast of poison gas at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Invent Gizmo ability

Uses your peerless coglin ingenuity to invent and assemble a one-of-a-kind
piece of equipment and permanently install it in yourself. Such inspiration
does not strike twice, so choose wisely.
%%%%
Hurl Damnation ability

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation. These unholy forces harm the victim and
anyone adjacent, and are not affected by any means of protection, such as armour
or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke
damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Word of Chaos ability

Speaks a word of chaos, forcing enemies nearby to blink away from the user.
Additionally, those affected may be slowed, ensnared, or terrified by the
experience. Invoking a word of chaos is no easy feat and will drain the user's
maximum health somewhat, and the ability then cannot be used again for a short
time.
%%%%
Heal Wounds ability

Heals the user significantly, with a chance of permanently reducing the user's
maximum magic capacity by one.
%%%%
Dig ability

Allows making tunnels through soft rock and rusted grates. Activating the
ability has no cost and simply prepares you to start digging; once active,
moving into a wall will start tunnelling. Doing so makes some noise and drains
the user's maximum health.

Once active, activating the ability again or making any non-digging movement
action will cancel the Dig status.
%%%%
Shaft Self ability

Sends you to a random position one to three floors down, as if you jumped into
a shaft trap. It takes some time to dig the shaft.
%%%%
Evoke Blink ability

Randomly translocates the user a short distance. After translocating in this
way, the ability cannot be activated again for a short period of time depending
on Evocations skill.
%%%%
Evoke Berserk Rage ability

<Berserk ability>
%%%%
Evoke Invisibility ability

Turns the user invisible. Turning invisible in this way causes magical
contamination. Reaching high levels of contamination will cause you to glow
brightly, nullifying the invisibility.
%%%%
End Transformation ability

Reverts you to your normal form.
%%%%
Begin Untransformation ability

Begins to transform you back into your native form. A short period of
concentration is required.
%%%%
Imbue Servitor ability

Chooses one of the caster's destructive spells to grant to Spellspark Servitors
they create in the future, replacing any spell granted to them previously. The
caster must be capable of casting this spell themselves with a failure rate of
no more than 20%.

Note: imbuing a spell in this manner will take several turns and also dismiss
your servitor if it is active.
%%%%
Imprint Weapon ability

Analyzes the structural composition of an artefact melee weapon in your
inventory and imprints it upon your Platinum Paragon spell, allowing it to wield
a functional replica of it whenever you create one.
%%%%
Cacophony ability

Fully manifests your poltergeist nature, making all the armour you are haunting
fly out and attack independently of your other actions for a short while - boots
and scarves and helmets assailing your foes from all directions while a gleeful
din fills the air.

These items are still tethered to you and cannot be directed more than a short
distance away, but you do not share any damage they suffer and can freely fire
through them. Their attacks may inflict a variety of minor maladies on your
foes - sometimes dazing, draining, or even confusing them.

After using this ability, you must gain experience points before you can recover
enough power to use it again.
%%%%
Bat Swarm ability

Scatters your physical form into a swarm of vampire bats, melding your equipment
but allowing you to move quickly and evasively. The number of bats that issue
from your body is so immense that it even fills nearby spaces like a choking
cloud, assailing enemies and gradually putting them to sleep.

After using this ability, you must gain experience points before you can recover
enough power to use it again.
%%%%
Enkindle ability

Stokes your ghostly flames to a fever pitch, greatly enhancing your spellcasting
at the cost of burning away all accumulated memories.

While in this state, your damage-dealing spells cost no MP, are unaffected by
encumbrance, and you receive a bonus to their spell success and power (the
latter of which increases with your experience level). Any spellclaw attack made
while Enkindled inflicts bonus damage proportional to the level of spell cast,
and heals you for a percentage of the damage dealt.

Each spell you cast while Enkindled consumes a memory, and the state will end
once you have no more left (or after a short period of time, regardless).

At your current experience level, you can hold enough memories to cast a maximum
of {{return 3 + math.floor(you.xl() * 3 / 20);}} spells in a row this way.
%%%%
# Zin
Recite ability

Preaches to nearby monsters about Zin's laws for a short duration. After
finishing a recitation, it cannot be repeated for a short time.

The recitation will have different effects depending on the target: the chaotic
and unclean will be affected by powerful and damaging effects, undead and
demons will be affected by weaker rebukes, and any other intelligent creatures
will have confusion sown amongst them, with heretics and priests of gods other
than Zin being punished much more strongly. The effectiveness of the recitation
is increased by Invocations skill and piety.
%%%%
Vitalisation ability

Temporarily provides protection from poison, confusion, petrification, and
sickness, as well as the effects of clouds of foul pestilence. Your strength,
intelligence and dexterity are also temporarily increased by a degree dependent
on Invocations skill.
%%%%
Imprison ability

Temporarily imprisons a monster in walls of silver. The duration of the prison
is increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Sanctuary ability

Creates a divine refuge for a short duration. While you are inside the
sanctuary, monsters will not attack you, but the protection will disappear at
once should you breach the divine peace.
%%%%
Cure All Mutations ability

Cures all your mutations â€” but only once.
%%%%
# The Shining One
Divine Shield ability

Manifests a blindingly bright shield in front of the user. Held aloft by the
Shining One's power, it will unerringly block the next several attacks which
could be blocked by a mundane shield. Ranged attacks will be reflected and melee
attackers have a chance of being briefly blinded by the resulting flash of
light.

This shield will block only a limited number of attacks before vanishing, with
Invocations skill increasing how many.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame ability

Invokes a huge blast of divine fury centered on the user, severely damaging
undead and demons and dealing damage to all other hostile creatures. The power
of the blast is increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Summon Divine Warrior ability

Summons a powerful warrior against evil, either an angel or a daeva. The
duration of their assistance is increased by Invocations skill, and glory in
battle may lead the Shining One to bless them with an even longer stay.
%%%%
Brand Weapon With Holy Wrath ability

Permanently blesses a weapon of your choice with the holy wrath of the Shining
One. Demon weapons will be converted into a more powerful sacred weapon. This
blessing may only be used once, and it cannot be used on artefact weapons.
%%%%
Unearth Wretches ability

Bring forth those near death from Kikubaaqudgha's necropolis, providing ample
fodder for all kinds of necromancy. Their number and quality is dependent on
Necromancy skill.
%%%%
Sign of Ruin ability

[[Sign of Ruin spell]]
%%%%
Brand Weapon With Pain ability

Permanently bloodies a weapon of your choice with the essence of pain
itself. This blessing cannot be used on artefact weapons. You must choose
between this gift or that of knowledge of the most powerful necromantic spells,
and either gift may only be received once.
%%%%
Receive Forbidden Knowledge ability

Grants you knowledge of the most powerful and sinister Necromancy spells:
Haunt, Borgnjor's Revivification, Infestation, and Death's Door. You must choose
between this gift or that of branding a weapon with pain, and either gift may
only be received once.
%%%%
# Yredelemnul
Recall Undead Harvest ability

Recalls your undead followers from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate
surroundings.
%%%%
Light the Black Torch ability

Raises the Black Torch aloft and calls upon Yredelemnul to light it aflame,
marking the beginning of your attempt to conquer the current level of the
dungeon. Yredelemnul only grants piety for kills made while the torch is lit.

Those who have earned some of Yredelemnul's favour will be gifted temporary
undead servants to help begin their conquest, with stronger servants being
provided to the experienced and especially pious.

Yredelemnul does not offer second chances - the torch will be extinguished when
you leave the current floor, and it may only be lit once per floor, ever.
%%%%
Hurl Torchlight ability

Hurls a gout of umbral fire from the Black Torch, which deals irresistible
damage to living, demonic, and holy beings. The torchlight will also briefly
empower any of your undead servants caught in its blast, and is harmless to its
user. The damage is increased by Invocations skill.

This ability can be used only while the torch is lit, and only a limited number
of times on each floor. The number of uses available per floor increases with
piety, and stoking the Black Torch's flames with a particularly remarkable soul
by killing a unique named enemy will also provide an additional use.
%%%%
Bind Soul ability

Attempts to bind the soul of a living, holy, or demonic being into your eternal
service. If the targeted monster is slain before it leaves your sight, it will
return as a bound soul, retaining the equipment, spells and abilities it had in
life.

Only beings who are relatively uninjured may be targeted, and the focus required
to keep their soul from escaping will consume 1/3 of the user's current health -
returning it only upon slaying them. The attempt will fail entirely if the
targeted monster leaves your sight before the process is complete.

The bound soul's health is influenced by the user's Invocations skill. It will
follow its captor through stairs, and can be recalled from other levels.

Only one soul can be bound at a time.
%%%%
Fathomless Shackles ability

Engulfs the user's surroundings in Yredelemnul's inexorable grip. So long as you
remain within this profane sanctuary, all hostile creatures that share it with
you will be bound in place, and their life force will be continuously drained to
restore your own. Victims who are isolated from their allies will take damage at
a greatly increased rate.

The affected area will shrink over time, and a new one cannot be created until
the old one has fully expired.
%%%%
# Okawaru
Heroism ability

Temporarily increases all of your combat skills, both offensive and defensive.
The duration is increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Finesse ability

Greatly increases your combat speed. The duration is increased by Invocations
skill.
%%%%
Duel ability

Enters you into single combat with a worthy foe. On success, you and the
challenged foe will be transported to Okawaru's Arena to fight to the death,
with no escape until you either emerge victorious or are slain.

Half of your missing health will be restored as the duel begins, and upon
victory, Okawaru will return your health and magical power to whatever they
were before you issued the challenge - letting you shake off any damage taken
during it in the blink of an eye.
%%%%
Receive Weapon ability

Acquires a weapon from a choice of four. This blessing may only be redeemed
once.
%%%%
Receive Armour ability

Acquires a piece of armour from a choice of four. This blessing may only be
redeemed once.
%%%%
# Makhleb
Unleash Destruction ability

Channels a blast of hellish {{
    if you.get_base_mutation_level("Gehenna destruction") == 1 then
        return "piercing fire, lava (from Gehenna's influence), lightning, or negative energy"
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Cocytus destruction") == 1 then
        return "piercing ice (from Cocytus' influence), cold, lightning, or negative energy"
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Tartarus destruction") == 1 then
        return "piercing fire, cold, devastation (from Tartarus' influence), or negative energy"
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Dis destruction") == 1 then
        return "piercing fire, cold, lightning, acid, or metal splinters (the last two from Dis' influence)"
    else
        return "fire, cold, lightning, or negative energy"
    end
}} at a targeted creature. Damage and accuracy are increased by Invocations
skill.
%%%%
Infernal Servant ability

Beckons a demon from the far reaches of Hell and binds it into service with your
blood. At low Invocations skill, only lesser devils may be summoned, but major
demons and even executioners may answer the call of those with high Invocations
skill.

Beware that the armies of chaos are prone to infighting, and sometimes a
hostile demon may answer the ritual alongside your summoned servant.
%%%%
Brand Self ability

Permanently carves an Infernal Mark into yourself, forever tainting body and
soul in service of the Destroyer.

So long as you continue to worship Makhleb, this mark will grant you the
following power:

%%%%
Infernal Legion ability

Uses one's own body as a conduit to unleash an army of chaos upon the world.
For a short while, lesser demons will continuously manifest near the user -
provided there is something around for them to fight. While these demons may
be individually short-lived, the legions of chaos as a whole are virtually
inexhaustible.
%%%%
Globe of Annihilation ability

Launches a roiling sphere of intense destructive force drawn from the {{
    if you.get_base_mutation_level("Gehenna destruction") == 1 then
        return "endless fires of Gehenna."
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Cocytus destruction") == 1 then
        return "frigid wastes of Cocytus."
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Tartarus destruction") == 1 then
        return "wailing grief of Tartarus."
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Dis destruction") == 1 then
        return "ruthless spite of Dis."
    else
        return "very Hells themselves."
    end
}}

This sphere gathers strength as it travels, and will attempt to home in on a
designated target, though it moves and turns with considerable inertia. When it
collides with a creature or other obstruction, it will detonate in a violent
explosion of {{
    if you.get_base_mutation_level("Gehenna destruction") == 1 then
        return "fire or lava"
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Cocytus destruction") == 1 then
        return "cold or ice"
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Tartarus destruction") == 1 then
        return "negative energy or devastation"
    elseif you.get_base_mutation_level("Dis destruction") == 1 then
        return "acid or metal splinters"
    else
        return "hellish energy"
    end
}} whose radius depends on the distance travelled.

You are protected from this explosion yourself.
%%%%
Vessel of Slaughter ability

Invokes a blood pact with the Destroyer, temporarily granting you enormous power
at a dangerous price.

At the moment the pact is sealed, a massive explosion of damnation will surround
you, and you will transform into a demonic avatar, granting you demonic
resistances, invulnerable will, doubled healing from kills, and reducing all
damage you take by 1/3. You will additionally gain a bonus to all outgoing
damage proportional to how injured you were when you used this ability.

When your transformation expires, you will be dragged down into the Crucible of
Flesh, and made to fight through waves of demons until Makhleb considers your
debt paid.
%%%%
# Sif Muna
%%%%
Channel Magic ability

Dramatically increases the user's regeneration of magical power for a duration
that increases with Invocations skill.
%%%%
Forget Spell ability

Removes a known spell from memory, so as to free memory to learn others.
%%%%
Divine Exegesis ability

Casts any spell from your spell library with guaranteed success. You receive a
bonus to spell power based on your Invocations skill that is worth 50% more
than equivalent levels of training in the relevant skills of the spell itself.
%%%%
# Trog
Berserk ability

Sends the user into a berserk rage. Going berserk temporarily increases health,
speed, and damage dealt in melee. It will time out quickly outside of combat,
but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, almost all actions other
than movement and melee combat are prevented. When the rage expires, the user
will be slowed and unable to berserk again for a short time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand ability

Invokes a powerful regeneration ability which stacks with all other sources and
is effective even on those who would not otherwise be able to regenerate. It
also fortifies the user's willpower, protecting against many magical effects.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms ability

Summons huge angry allies to wreak havoc.
%%%%
# Elyvilon
Purification ability

Purges your body of poison, confusion, slowness, petrification, weakness, and
sickness. Any drained maximum health will also be fully restored.
%%%%
Heal Other ability

Heals a creature other than yourself by a moderate amount, depending on
Invocations skill. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to turn them
neutral. This works best on living creatures, with the undead and demons being
progressively harder to pacify. Intelligent creatures are also more difficult
to pacify.

Ghosts of dead adventurers and demon lords are too wrathful to be pacified,
mindless creatures are too unintelligent to be pacified, and no monster can be
pacified while it is asleep.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested piety and magic points
are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain the monster's
full experience value. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you gain
nothing.
%%%%
Heal Self ability

Heals a moderate amount of health, depending on Invocations skill.
%%%%
Divine Vigour ability

Greatly increases your maximum health and magic points, depending on
Invocations skill. Your current health and magic points will also be increased
proportionally.
%%%%
# Lugonu
Depart the Abyss ability

Transports you out of the Abyss, returning you to the location from which you
entered it.
%%%%
Banish ability

Attempts to banish a creature into the Abyss. If the attempt succeeds, you gain
some piety and the creature's full experience value. Even creatures that resist
are left malmutated and weakened by the brush with the Abyss. Invocations skill
makes Banishment harder to resist.
%%%%
Corrupt ability

Corrupts the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will
cause the area nearby to change appearance, and will gate in creatures from the
Abyss bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already
corrupted or in the Abyss itself. The size of the effect is increased by
Invocations skill.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss ability

Transports you to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health depleted.
%%%%
Brand Weapon With Distortion ability

Permanently corrupts a weapon of your choice with a localised field of
distortion. This blessing may only be used once, and it cannot be used on
artefact weapons.
%%%%
# Nemelex Xobeh

single card.
%%%%
Stack Five ability

any order. Subsequently, you can draw these cards in the order you chose.
Re-using this ability will discard the current stack.
%%%%
# Beogh
Smiting ability

[[Smiting spell]] The strength of the smiting is increased by Invocations skill.

Beogh will not allow you to use this directly against another apostle during a
divine trial.
%%%%
Recall Apostles ability

Recalls your apostles from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate
surroundings.
%%%%
Dismiss Apostle ability

Frees this apostle from your service, sending them out to do good in the world
in Beogh's name.
%%%%
Recruit Apostle ability

Anoints a defeated apostle, and welcomes them as a permanent follower. They will
follow you between floors and into any peril, willingly giving their life for
the cause and their kin.

If they die, Beogh will eventually revive them once you gain sufficient piety -
this process can be greatly accelerated by satisfying Beogh with the slaying of
all foes who may have contributed to their apostle's death.

You can have at most 3 followers accompanying you at a time, though you may
freely dismiss old ones to invite new ones.
%%%%
Blood for Blood ability

Beseeches Beogh to grant you an army with which to wreak bloody retribution.
The user will be immediately surrounded by orcish allies, with more of them
arriving over time from all directions. The prayer lasts a considerable
length of time, but will expire far more rapidly once there are no more foes in
sight.

Usable only while you are standing over the corpse of one of your apostles, and
at most once per death.
%%%%
# Fedhas
Wall of Briars ability

Grows short-lived briar patches around you. Monsters attacking these briars will
be damaged by sharp thorns. Invocations skill increases the briars' health.
%%%%
Grow Ballistomycete ability

Grows a short-lived ballistomycete at the location you choose. A ballistomycete
occasionally releases spores that quickly seek out foes and violently explode,
damaging and confusing all living things caught in the blast.

Invocations skill increases the health and duration of the ballistomycete as
well as the damage of its exploding spores.
%%%%
Overgrow ability

Permanently destroys a wall-like structure, growing a short-lived plant ally in
its place. Even a tree will give its life to support the will of Fedhas, and
only truly indestructible walls are immune to this power.
%%%%
Grow Oklob ability

Grows a short-lived oklob plant at the location you choose. These dangerous
plants spray corrosive vitriol at your foes.

Invocations skill increases the health and duration of the oklob as well as the
frequency with which it sprays its acid.
%%%%
# Cheibriados
Bend Time ability

Attempts to slow down everyone adjacent to you. High Invocations skill makes it
harder to resist.
%%%%
Temporal Distortion ability

Warps the flow of time, causing monsters to skip forwards in time relative to
you.
%%%%
Slouch ability

Causes damage to everyone in sight who is moving faster than you, dealing more
damage with greater differences in speed.
%%%%
Step From Time ability

Removes you completely from the flow of time. Time will pass as it usually does,
and monsters will wander away and sometimes even fall back to sleep. After some
time has passed, you will return in the same state as the very second you
departed.

Invocations skill increases the likelihood that your absence will have been so
long that alert monsters have fallen asleep again.
%%%%
# Jiyva
Slimify ability

Coats a wielded weapon or your fists with slime, turning the next living or
corporeal undead monster hit into a neutral slime.
%%%%
Oozemancy ability

Calls forth acidic ooze from the walls of the dungeon around you, damaging foes
depending on the number of slimy walls they remain adjacent to.
%%%%

and the item both are broken. Cursed items can no longer be enchanted or
modified.
%%%%
Shatter The Chains ability

Destroys a chosen cursed equipped item, relieving the wearer of the curse.
%%%%
# Dithmenos
Shadowslip ability

Instantly swaps places with your shadow (so long as it is active) and misleads
all enemies in sight about which of the two is which. Enemies which were
previously focused on you will instead focus their attention exclusively upon
your shadow for several turns before they realize their mistake - though if they
succeed in destroying your shadow, the illusion will end prematurely.

The duration of this effect increases with Invocations skill, as will the
durability of your shadow immediately after using it.
%%%%
Aphotic Marionette ability

Grabs hold of another creature's shadow and rapidly unleashes their spells and
abilities as if they were your own, aimed at random enemies. Creatures they
summon this way will belong to you, and many beneficial effects that they would
apply to themselves will be applied to you instead. You are also fully protected
from any damage they would cause.

Can only be used on creatures with eligible spells that they could productively
cast at the moment. The process also leaves the victim's shadow too dim to grasp
a second time - once used successfully on a target, it may never be used on them
again.

(Not all spells can be cast via this method; those which cannot will be marked
with an exclamation mark when examined.)
%%%%
Primordial Nightfall ability

Invokes a night from before the stars first burned in the sky, engulfing your
surroundings in impenetrable darkness. The user's sight radius will be reduced
to nothing, preventing enemies from tracking or aiming abilities at you, and
slowly expand back to normal over the duration of the effect. Your stealth will
also be increased.

It cannot be invoked again until its effect has fully ended, as even the very
first night of creation must eventually give way to day.

Invocations skill increases the duration of the effect.
%%%%
# Gozag
Potion Petition ability

Petitions Gozag to sell you the effects of a set of potions. Gozag will offer
three lists at a time, with varying prices.
%%%%
Call Merchant ability

Sends funds to a merchant to help them set up shop at your location. The cost of
funding a shop increases with the number of shops funded.
%%%%
Bribe Branch ability

Gives 3000 gold to Gozag to spread throughout the inhabitants of the current
branch, only possible if the branch has intelligent inhabitants. Those monsters
may then become uninterested in fighting you (with tougher inhabitants having
an increasing chance of being bribed), and more rarely will join your ranks,
though they will not leave their home branch. Enemies accepting a bribe will
lower the remaining bribe fund; upon its exhaustion, bribed enemies will become
indifferent if they have not become your allies.
%%%%
# Qazlal
Upheaval ability

Calls on the forces of nature to blast a small area with magma, ice, wind,
or rubble. This blast will never harm you or any elementals manifested by you.

Invocations skill increases the maximum number of elementals that can be
created with one use of the ability.
%%%%

skill increases both damage and area affected.
%%%%
# Ru
Draw Out Power ability

body and mind from external constraints, including nets, webs, constriction,
petrification, slowness, and confusion. The amount of health and magic restored
increases with piety.

Performs an incredibly fast leap to a targeted location, causing an explosion
upon landing which damages all adjacent foes. The amount of damage done
increases with your piety and experience level.
%%%%

Reveals Ru's truth to your enemies, dealing severe damage to all enemies in
your line of sight. Affected creatures may be paralysed, slowed or have their
magic drained. The damage dealt increases with your piety and experience level.

%%%%

Sacrifices forms, preventing you from voluntarily changing your form and from
having any ranks in the Shapeshifting skill.
%%%%
Sacrifice Artifice ability

Sacrifices the ability to evoke any magical items, and prevents you from having
any ranks in the Evocations skill.

This includes wands and other items which use Evocations skill - that is, it does
*not* affect reaching weapons, talismans, and ziggurat figurines. This also renders
magical staves much less effective in melee.
%%%%
Sacrifice Love ability

Sacrifices love, causing all creatures to become hostile, even those created
by you. Monsters that are spell residue and which do not act independently,
such as orbs of destruction and spectral weapons, are the only things which can
remain friendly.
%%%%
Sacrifice Courage ability

Sacrifices courage, causing you to become terrified of dangerous monsters. Such
monsters fill you with horror, which reduces the power of your spells and your
ability to hit and damage monsters in combat.
%%%%
Sacrifice Arcana ability

magic and preventing you from having any ranks in those skills.
%%%%

%%%%

skill. This sacrifice is worth more if you cannot train Dodging.
%%%%
Sacrifice a Hand ability

Sacrifices a hand, causing you to lose the ability to use shields{{

        return " and two-handed weapons"
    end
}}, and to be able to wear one fewer ring.
%%%%
Sacrifice Experience ability

Sacrifices some of your past experiences, causing you to lose one level
immediately and also to have the maximum level you can attain lowered by one.
%%%%
Sacrifice Skill ability

Sacrifices your skills, causing you to have all of your skill aptitudes
decreased by one. This will likely cause you to lose ranks in trained skills.
%%%%
Sacrifice an Eye ability

Sacrifices an eye, causing you to have a much harder time hitting targets.
%%%%
Sacrifice Resistance ability

Sacrifices your resistance to extreme temperatures, causing you to become
vulnerable to heat and cold.
%%%%
Reject Sacrifices ability

Rejects all offered sacrifices. Doing so means Ru will take more time
evaluating your readiness for future sacrifices. Ru will not offer more
sacrifices while there is an existing offer still extended.

Each consecutive rejection increases the sacrifice timer significantly.
Accepting a sacrifice will reset the timer to the standard length.
%%%%
# Uskayaw
Stomp ability

Stomps down in time with the rhythm of the dance, sending a shockwave through
all adjacent creatures. The shockwave damages each creature by a fraction of
its current health, plus damage increasing with Invocations skill.
%%%%
Line Pass ability

Passes through a contiguous line of creatures at superhuman speed, ending up
in a new location. Any creatures passed through in this way will be confused
briefly, with the duration of confusion increasing with Invocations skill.
%%%%
Grand Finale ability

Merges with a target emotionally and physically, and then bursts forth from
them, violently splitting them apart and killing them instantly. This ability
becomes easier to use as the worshipper's piety and Invocations skill increase.

More violent Uskayaw sects consider their members not to be true worshippers
until they have performed this rite.
%%%%
Renounce Religion ability

Renounces your faith. This will make you leave your god (and usually anger
said god).
%%%%
Convert to Beogh ability

Swears fealty to Beogh, the god of cave orcs. This god demands that all
non-believers must die, but new believers must be spared and accepted into the
fold. Beware, for orcs who do not see you convert may still be hostile until
you have built your reputation!

All other gods hate Beogh, and do not take desertion lightly.
%%%%
Donate Gold ability

Donates half of your gold to Zin, which will increase your piety over time. The
overall increase is determined by the size of your donation.
%%%%
Recall Ancestor ability

Recalls your ancestor from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate
surroundings.
%%%%
Idealise ability

Restores your ancestor to an idyllic vision of their best self. Their wounds
are forgotten and a glow of perfection infuses them, giving them a short-lived
but dramatic increase in strength, spellcasting, and armour. The quality of the
healing and duration of the idealisation granted are both improved by the
Invocations skill.
%%%%
Transference ability

Forces a targeted creature to pass through the realms of memory and exchange
places with your ancestor.

With great piety, those near the target will be drained to a degree depending
on Invocations skill.
%%%%
Ancestor Life: Knight ability

Remembers your ancestor as a knight, a strong melee combatant with superior
defences. This choice is permanent and cannot be undone.
%%%%
Ancestor Life: Battlemage ability

Remembers your ancestor as a battlemage, a warrior capable of relentless offence
with both melee and conjurations. This choice is permanent and cannot be undone.
%%%%
Ancestor Life: Hexer ability

Remembers your ancestor as a hexer, a cunning rogue capable of swift
knifework and debilitating spellcasting. This choice is permanent and cannot be
undone.
%%%%
Ancestor Identity ability

Recalls who your ancestor preferred to be known as, correcting their name and
gender.
%%%%
Wall Jump ability

Vaults off an adjacent wall towards enemies, striking all enemies adjacent to
the landing spot and taking two turns to complete the motion.
%%%%
Serpent's Lash ability

Allows you to move at supernatural speeds, making any normal movements up to a
distance of two tiles instant. Martial attacks performed under the effect of
Serpent's Lash are more damaging and never miss.
%%%%
Heavenly Storm ability

Invokes a storm of heavenly clouds. While the storm rages, your evasion and
combat accuracy and damage are substantially increased, and striking enemies
with martial attacks increases this bonus. The storm weakens over time and
fades away once the bonus reaches zero. The heavenly clouds prevent
invisibility, and obscure the vision of those outside the storm.
%%%%
Fiery Armour ability

Armours yourself in fire, providing +7 AC and searing foes foolish enough to
strike you in melee. The fire takes quite a long time to burn out.
%%%%
Foxfire Swarm ability

Conjures a swarm of animate flames all around you. These rapidly seek the
nearest monsters, burning them. They will dissipate harmlessly if unable to
reach a target or if you swap places with them.
%%%%
Rising Flame ability

Sends you floating upward and, after a short delay for Ignis to gather enough
power, blasts you through the ceiling and into the level above. This ability
may only be used once.
%%%%
Hop ability

Hops toward a chosen destination, landing somewhere nearby. After using this
ability, you will be unable to hop again until you have spent some time not
moving. (Other actions, such as casting spells and attacking, are fine.)
%%%%
Blinkbolt ability

Turns the user into living lightning and zaps them at the chosen monster,
dealing electric damage to everything in their path and depositing the user
at the bolt's end. After using this ability, you will be unable to use it
again for a short time.
%%%%
Siphon Essence ability

Torments nearby living foes, halving their health. The pain inflicted heals
the user to an extent determined by Shapeshifting skill. After using this
ability, you will be unable to use it again for a short time.
%%%%
Evoke the Sceptre of Asmodeus ability

Calls on the power of Asmodeus to summon fiery demons of Hell. The demons
summoned will remain friendly only for a limited time, eventually becoming
hostile before vanishing. The success of the ability scales with the Evocations
skill, and this ability is available only while wielding the Sceptre of
Asmodeus.
%%%%
Evoke Damnation ability

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation. These unholy forces harm the victim and
anyone adjacent, and are not affected by any means of protection, such as armour
or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke
damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation. The power of this
ability scales with the Evocations skill.
%%%%
Evoke the Staff of Olgreb ability

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything in line of sight for as long as the aura lasts. The power of this
ability scales with the Evocations skill, and this ability is available only
while wielding the Staff of Olgreb.
