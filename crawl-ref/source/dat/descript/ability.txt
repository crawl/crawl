%%%%
Breathe Lightning ability

Breathe Sticky Flame ability

several rounds until they eventually go out. It may splash on impact.
%%%%
Breathe Steam ability

Breathe a jet of steam at a targeted monster.
%%%%
Breathe Noxious Fumes ability

Breathe a blast of noxious fumes at a targeted monster.
%%%%
Bat Form ability

Turn into a speedy vampire bat. In bat form, you can neither interact with
items in any form (except picking them up or dropping them), nor cast spells.
Note that Bat Form will decrease your current Strength while increasing your
Dexterity. Thus, you won't be able to change form if your Strength is too low.
The flight is magically augmented, so you will stay in the air even if the
weight of your possessions or some disability would normally drag you down.
%%%%
Bottle Blood ability

At experience level 6 and higher, Vampires can bottle the blood from non-rotten
and blood-containing corpses they are standing on. Doing so requires the
capability of wielding your knife, as is the case for butchering.
%%%%

%%%%
# Both for Fly I and II.

Start flying. During flight you can safely cross water and similar obstacles.
Be warned, though, that flight may time out at inopportune moments and cause
you to fall to your death.
%%%%
Jump Attack

An ability that borrows a creature's kinetic energy to power a high-speed jump
attack, landing you safely nearby while dealing increased damage if successful. You
cannot jump over flying enemies and can only leap giant enemies submerged in
lava or deep water. Standing or swimming in water, lava, or liquified ground
will also prevent you from using this ability. Felids are natural jumpers and
will become more skilled at pouncing upon reaching experience levels 6 and 12.
%%%%
Hellfire ability

Blast your enemies with hellfire. This ball of unholy flames explodes on
impact, and is not affected by any means of protection such as armour or
resistances. However, certain creatures, usually fire-based, are immune to
hellfire entirely.

cost in terms of magic or hunger.

%%%%
Evoke Teleportation ability

Teleport yourself to a random location on the level.
%%%%
Evoke Blink ability

<Blink ability>
%%%%
Evoke Berserk Rage ability

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your hit points
and damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill
anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot
perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff
something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually
followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, cannot
berserk again, and occasionally even pass out.
%%%%
Evoke Invisibility ability

Turn yourself invisible for a limited amount of time. Turning invisible
increases your magical contamination and may eventually cause glowing.
%%%%
Turn Visible ability

Turn visible again.
%%%%
Evoke Flight ability

<Fly ability>
%%%%
Evoke Jump Attack ability

An ability that borrows a creature's kinetic energy to power a high-speed jump
attack, landing you safely nearby while dealing increased damage if successful. You
cannot jump over flying enemies and can only leap giant enemies submerged in
lava or deep water. Standing or swimming in water, lava, or liquified ground
will also prevent you from using this ability. Training evocations increases the
range of your jump-attack at skill levels 5 and 10.
%%%%
Stop Flying ability

Stop flying.
%%%%
Evoke Fog ability

Release a thick cloud of fog to obscure vision.
%%%%
Evoke Teleport Control ability

Gain the ability to control your next translocation – either by selecting an
approximate target for a teleport, or by selecting a direction for a blink. Be
wary that controlled translocations will cause the subject to become
contaminated with magical energy, and that controlled teleports will take
longer to trigger than uncontrolled ones.
%%%%
End Transformation ability

Revert to your normal form, with a short delay.
%%%%
# Zin
Recite ability

Preach to monsters about Zin's laws, which can lead to various results. There
are four books you can preach from:

* Book of Abominations: This book deals with the very thing most abhorrent to
Zin — chaos in all its forms. These recitations will invoke Zin's most powerful
smiting.

* Book of Ablutions: The impure are nearly as loathed by the Law-Giver.
Recitations from this book will deal damage to such creatures.

* Book of Apostates: Intelligent creatures who do not worship Zin but do no
other evil will be dealt with least harshly. The recitations from this book
merely sow confusion. Yet those who dare to worship a god alien to Zin may be
permanently deprived of means to spread their foul faith.

* Book of Anathema: Demons and the undead are hated by Zin. This book gives you
means to rebuke them.
%%%%
Vitalisation ability

Vitalise yourself, gaining divine stamina and sustenance from Zin. Divine
stamina protects you from sickness, poisoning, petrification, confusion and
rot, and temporarily boosts and sustains your Strength, Intelligence and
Dexterity.
%%%%
Imprison ability

Temporarily imprison a monster in walls of silver. The duration of the prison
is increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Sanctuary ability

For a short duration gain safety in a divine refuge. While you are inside the
sanctuary, monsters will not attack you, but the protection will disappear at
once should you breach the divine peace.
%%%%
Cure All Mutations ability

Cure all your mutations — but only once.
%%%%
# The Shining One
Divine Shield ability

The Shining One grants you a divine shield. Because it is held aloft by godly
power, it does not interfere with your equipment. However, it is controlled by
your willpower, and your skill with Shields will improve it.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame ability

Invoke a huge blast of divine fury centered on you, severely damaging undead
and demons. All other hostiles also take damage, if less so, whereas you and
your allies are never affected.
%%%%
Summon Divine Warrior ability

Summon an angel or daeva, powerful warriors against evil. They may be blessed
by the Shining One to stay longer in this world.
%%%%
# Kikubaaqudgha
Receive Corpses ability

Create one or more reanimatable monster corpses near yourself. The number and
freshness of these are dependent on Necromancy skill.
%%%%
Torment ability

Sacrifice a cadaver to make everyone in sight, including you, experience all
the pain that being suffered in its life. This will decimate the resilience of
all those who can feel it.

Kikubaaqudgha may choose to protect you from it... or may not.
%%%%

skeletons cannot leave the level they were created on.

Enslave Soul ability

Mark a living intelligent monster's soul as ripe for the taking. Once the
marked monster dies, its soul will be yours.

The enslaved soul will retain the monster's faculties, equipment and abilities,
as well as some of its innate healing. However, only a relatively uninjured
monster can have its soul marked, and only one soul can be enslaved at a time.
Furthermore, the duration of the mark is dependent on Invocations skill.

Note that enslaved souls can follow you beyond the level they were created on.
%%%%
Animate Remains or Dead ability

If you get this description, it is a bug.
%%%%
# Okawaru
Heroism ability

Temporarily increase all of your combat skills, including the ability to sneak
around.
%%%%
Finesse ability

Greatly increase your combat speed, with no loss of accuracy. This unnatural
effect causes small amounts of magic contamination, prolonged exposure to which
may be bad for your health.
%%%%
# Makhleb
Minor Destruction ability

Shoot a random harmful blast at the targeted monster.
%%%%
Lesser Servant of Makhleb ability

# Trog
Burn Spellbooks ability

Set all spellbooks within your field of vision on fire. The fire is fuelled by
Trog's hatred, and Trog likes it most when you don't even care which books of
madness burst into flames.
%%%%
Berserk ability

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your hit points
and damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill
anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot
perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff
something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually
followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, and
cannot berserk again. Unlike other sources of rage, depending on your piety
Trog may occasionally prevent you from passing out.
%%%%
Trog's Hand ability

Invoke a powerful regeneration ability which stacks with all other sources and
even allows otherwise non-healing species to regenerate. This will also
increase protection from magical effects.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms ability

Summon huge angry allies to wreak havoc.
%%%%
# Elyvilon
Divine Protection ability

Beseech Elyvilon to save your life. If you are mortally wounded, the Healer may
undo the killing blow. Especially pious individuals may be certain of this
help, but in that case, any actual intervention costs piety (as opposed to
merely asking for intervention, which is always free).

Beware: killing others while asking to be spared yourself is a major sin!
%%%%
Lesser Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a small
amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them neutral.
This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still worse on
other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless creatures
cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is asleep. The
chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food and magic point are
lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half the monster's
experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected
and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Lesser Self-Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a small amount of hit points.
%%%%
Purification ability

Purge your body of all bad effects such as sickness, poisoning, slowness,
petrification, confusion and rot, and fully restore your Strength, Dexterity
and Intelligence.
%%%%
Greater Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a
moderate amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them
neutral. This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still
worse on other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless
creatures cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is
asleep. The chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power, so
it is significantly better than using Lesser Healing.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food, piety and magic
points are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half
the monster's experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster
is unaffected and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Greater Self-Healing ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a moderate amount of hit points.
Roughly, Greater Healing will allow you to heal three times the amount of
Lesser Healing at a slightly higher total piety cost.
%%%%
Divine Vigour ability

Depending on your Invocations skill, restore a large amount of, and temporarily
increase, both your hit points and your magic points.
%%%%

distance, and possibly also translocating and damaging monsters in your
vicinity.
%%%%
Banish ability

Attempt to banish a monster into the Abyss.
%%%%
Corrupt ability

Corrupt the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will cause
the level to largely change appearance, and will gate in demons from the Abyss
bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already corrupted or
in the Abyss.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss ability

Transfer yourself to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health and magic depleted.
%%%%
# Nemelex Xobeh
Draw One ability

Choose any deck in your inventory and draw a card from it.
%%%%
Peek at Two ability

inscribed as containing those two cards, and, if they are different, this will
identify the deck.
%%%%
Triple Draw ability

Draw three cards from any deck in your inventory, look at them, and decide
which one to keep, discarding the other two.
%%%%
Deal Four ability

Deal four cards from any unmarked deck in the time it normally takes to draw a
single card. The rest of the deck is lost. If the deck does not contain enough
cards, Nemelex will give you one extra card, but you might not like it.
%%%%
Stack Five ability

Draw five cards from any unmarked deck in your inventory, losing the rest of
the deck. Look at the cards and sort them into any order you'd like.
Subsequently, you can draw these cards in the order you chose.
%%%%
# Beogh

%%%%
# Fedhas

the light will be easier to hit. Water affected by the sunlight will evaporate.
In particular, deep water will become shallow water, and shallow water will dry
up completely, revealing the dungeon floor.
%%%%
Growth ability

Use fruit to grow a ring of plants around yourself. If a complete ring cannot
be formed (because you do not have enough fruit), plants will grow on squares
adjacent to you that are close to monsters. The plants you create gain bonus HP
proportional to your Invocations skill.
%%%%
Rain ability

Cause rain to fall around yourself, turning the dungeon floor into shallow
water and shallow water into deep water. This is likely to allow plants and
mushrooms to grow in areas not directly drenched.
%%%%
Reproduction ability

Create giant spores from corpses in your line of sight. The spores will
explode, causing damage to you or your enemies.
%%%%
Evolution ability

Turn plants and fungi into stronger species. Upgrading fungi requires piety,
while upgrading plants requires fruit. Upgraded plants gain a bonus to attack
accuracy proportional to the user's Invocations skill, and oklob plants are
more likely to spit acid at higher Invocations.
%%%%
# Cheibriados
Bend Time ability

Attempt to slow down everyone adjacent to you. High Invocations skill makes it
harder to resist.
%%%%
Temporal Distortion ability

Warp the flow of time around you, causing monsters to skip forwards in time
relative to you.
%%%%
Slouch ability

Cause damage to everyone in sight who is moving faster than you. Those
magically hasted will be hurt particularly painfully.
%%%%
Step From Time ability

%%%%
Transfer Knowledge ability

Sacrifice part of one of your skills to improve another.
%%%%
End Transfer Knowledge ability

%%%%
Renounce Religion ability

Renounce your faith. This will make your character leave your god (and usually
anger said god).
%%%%
Convert to Beogh ability

Swear your fealty to Beogh, the god of cave orcs. This god demands that all
non-believers must die, but new believers must be spared and accepted into the
fold. Beware, for orcs who haven't seen you convert may still be hostile until
you've built your reputation!

All other gods hate Beogh, and don't take desertion lightly.
