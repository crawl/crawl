Screaming Sword

<Singing Sword>
%%%%
Wrath of Trog

This was the favourite weapon of the old god Trog, before it was lost. It
induces a bloodthirsty berserker rage in warriors who use it in battle.
%%%%
Mace of Variability

A weapon with a peculiar reputation — said to be at times peerless in quality,
and other times virtually useless. No one knows exactly who would have made
such a weapon, or why, but Xom is probably to blame somehow.
%%%%
Glaive of Prune

This weapon is the creation of a mad god, and carries a curse which transforms
anyone wielding it into a prune. Fortunately, the curse works very slowly, and
one can use it briefly with no consequences worse than slightly purple skin and
a few wrinkles.
%%%%
Sword of Power

This sword rewards the powerful with power and the meek with weakness.
%%%%
Staff of Olgreb

This was the weapon wielded by the mighty wizard Olgreb, before he met his fate
somewhere within these dungeons. It increases the power of its wielder's
poison magic, and can be evoked to activate its own venomous spells. Its touch
may poison even resistant creatures, and it grants protection from all venoms
while wielded.
%%%%
Staff of Wucad Mu

This staff can be evoked to restore large amounts of magical energy, but with
the risk of damaging the user's mind. Its power depends on the wielder's
Evocations skill.
%%%%
Vampire's Tooth

This ivory-like dagger looks like it could have been crafted from the tooth of
some enormous predatory creature. It is lethally vampiric, and restores a
greater portion of life to its user than other vampiric weapons.
%%%%
Scythe of Curses

This weapon carries a terrible and highly irritating curse, which it busily
inflicts on both the wielder and their enemies.
%%%%
Sceptre of Torment

This truly accursed weapon is an instrument of Hell.
%%%%
Sword of Zonguldrok

This dreadful weapon is used at the user's peril. Those slain in its presence
are reanimated by its power and forced to fight on.
%%%%
Sword of Cerebov

Eerie flames cover its twisted blade. Its demonic power burns away some of the
defender's fire resistance.
%%%%
Staff of Dispater

This legendary item can unleash the fires of Hell. All but Dispater will find
the flames sear their own flesh, as well - but since when have such details
stopped anyone in their quest for power?
%%%%
Sceptre of Asmodeus

This sceptre carries some of the powers of the arch-fiend Asmodeus. Evoking it
can summon fiery demons from their infernal home to do your bidding, although
they will not remain enslaved for long.
%%%%
faerie dragon armour

Faerie dragons were once a breed of the same species as mottled dragons. Their
vivid colours proved to be their bane, as they alerted potential prey. They are
now extinct, and this prized relic is one of the last proofs they ever existed.
%%%%
demon blade "Bloodbane"

This blade carries the bloody taint of an inhuman madman.
%%%%
scimitar of Flaming Death

A scimitar with a mysteriously smoking blade. Occasionally its heat leaks out,
covering opponents in magical flame.
%%%%
eveningstar "Brilliance"

This eveningstar illuminates the dungeon's recesses, but its halo may alert
enemies to your presence. Its light is hated by the undead, and reveals the
machinations of those who would prefer to stay invisible.
%%%%
demon blade "Leech"

This weapon drives its owner's mind into a narrow purpose: gorging on drained
life force. It is unerringly vampiric, draining life every time it strikes.
%%%%
dagger of Chilly Death

A dagger made of one huge shard of sapphire. It covers opponents in ice,
slowing down their movement somewhat.
%%%%
dagger "Morg"

An ugly rusty dagger. Many years ago it was the property of a powerful mage
called Boris. He got lost in the Dungeon while seeking the Orb.
%%%%
scythe "Finisher"

A long and sharp scythe, specially modified to be quickly swung in combat.
%%%%
greatsling "Punk"

A sling made of weird blue leather. Originally the weapon of a notorious
mischief-maker and general scamp, it's since fallen into less savoury hands.
%%%%
bow of Krishna "Sharnga"

A wonderful golden longbow that once belonged to a god of distant lands. It can
fire as fast as thought and hurl divine arrows of terrible power — though,
sadly, none seem to be available here.
%%%%
giant club "Skullcrusher"

This lovely cudgel can make any ogre overjoyed — be it at a bar brawl,
genocide, or a mixture of both.
%%%%
glaive of the Guard

This weapon was commissioned several years ago by a wealthy queen fearful for
the safety of her vast treasury. No foe, the smith promised, could defeat a
guard wielding this weapon!

The glaive was stolen a few months later, along with the rest of the queen's
treasury; the guard, it transpired, had been caught napping. Still, it should
serve more than adequately in the hands of a waking user.
%%%%
sword of Jihad

A long sword made of one huge piece of crystal. Legend says it was the Shining
One's gift to a worshipper. This blade is notorious for inducing bloodthirsty
rage in both the wielder and all of his or her mortal followers.
%%%%
arbalest "Hellfire"

A flaming crossbow, forged in the fires of the Hells. It imbues bolts it fires
with the raw power of its namesake, irresistible by any mortal armour or
fireproofing.
%%%%
sword of the Doom Knight

An adamantine great sword. Its first wielder was a worshipper of Yredelemnul
who eschewed the use of magic in combat, preferring to destroy his enemies with
brute force. Unfortunately for him, not all of his opponents shared his
limitations.
%%%%
morningstar "Eos"

The rosy fingers of the Dawn...
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
spear of the Botono

A dark and malign artefact. It increases the potency of hexes cast by anyone
unwise enough to risk wielding it.
%%%%
trident of the Octopus King

This trident was stolen many years ago from the Octopus King's garden. Luckily,
he seems to be in no hurry to get it back.
%%%%
mithril axe "Arga"

A beautiful mithril axe, probably lost by some dwarven hero.
%%%%
Elemental Staff

This powerful staff used to belong to the leader of the Guild of Five Elements.
In addition to the protection it provides, those skilled in Evocations may
use it to discharge powerful blasts of elemental energy with their strikes.
%%%%
heavy crossbow "Sniper"

A huge crossbow made of some black material. It is highly damaging, but
extremely cumbersome to load.
%%%%
longbow "Piercer"

An exceptionally large metal longbow.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
blowgun of the Assassin

This blowgun seems to guide the needle to seek the most lethal point to hit
the target, packing a nasty punch.
%%%%
lance "Wyrmbane"

An enchanted lance deadly to all dragonkind. It grows more powerful every time
it inflicts a killing blow on a strong dragon. The more powerful it grows, the
harder it will be to find a worthy opponent.
%%%%
Spriggan's Knife

This dainty little knife was made by Spriggans, or for Spriggans, or possibly
from Spriggans. Anyway, it's in some way associated with those fey folk.
%%%%
plutonium sword

A triple sword made of weird glowing metal. Anyone hit with it stands a good chance
of enjoying a variety of exciting new medical conditions... if they survive
the impact of the blade itself, that is.
%%%%
great mace "Undeadhunter"

Legends say that, long ago, a lich lord experimented with creating sentient
servants instead of mindless automatons. To ensure their loyalty, he made
weapons specially designed to destroy the magic that holds undead together.

Although the lich met his end long ago, his weapons, spreading disruption among
the undead, found use long after his passing. Sadly, this mace might be the
last one left.
%%%%
whip "Snakebite"

A double-ended whip made from the cured hides of black mambas, and enchanted
with toxins ranging from ordinary venoms to asphyxiating curare.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
knife of Accuracy

It is almost unerringly accurate.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
Lehudib's crystal spear

Presumably this relic led to the invention of the famous spell, or maybe the
other way around.
%%%%
captain's cutlass

This infamous weapon was used by a vile pirate captain to slaughter countless
innocents. He finally met his destiny when a kraken swallowed his ship, and the
cutlass was thought to be lost with him.

This weapon is perfectly suited for relieving opponents of their weapons, just
before it relieves them of their lives.
%%%%
storm bow

This longbow has the colour of dark rain clouds.
{{

%%%%
large shield of Ignorance

This shield, unearthed from the remains of a ruined city, bears an inscription
written in an ancient language. Scholars and wise men laboured for countless
hours to decipher it, poring through ancient tomes and hurling theses and
counter-theses back and forth. In time, interest faded, and a grudging
consenus translation was settled on:

"With a shield like this, who needs to think?"
%%%%
robe of Augmentation

"The clothes make the man."
%%%%
cloak of the Thief

It allows its wearer to excel in the arts of thievery, and can be evoked to

robe of Misfortune

A splendid flowing robe of fur and silk.
%%%%
cloak of Flash

A cloak that twitches and jerks without any intervention.
%%%%
boots of the Assassin

wearer more perceptive of potential victims, and grant the ability to find
vulnerabilities when attacking unaware opponents.
%%%%
Lear's hauberk

A well-made golden hauberk that covers all of its wearer's body parts. It
includes a chainmail coif, chausses and maille gauntlets.
%%%%
skin of Zhor

The {{

    end
}}skin of some strange animal, native to cold and distant lands.
%%%%
salamander hide armour

A leather armour made of a salamander's skin.
%%%%
gauntlets of War

These thick steel gauntlets were Okawaru's reward for a mighty warlord. The
owner is destined to die in battle, but what a death it will be!
%%%%
shield of Resistance

A bronze shield, looking almost exactly like a tortoise's shell. It was built
by the adherents of an obscure minor faith, who imbued it with the power of
their god. As the god is said to, this shield protects against sword and sling,
frost and flame.
%%%%
robe of Folly

A dull grey robe. It is enchanted to provide its wearer with immeasurable power
and wisdom, but...
%%%%
Maxwell's patent armour

Created by the famous inventor, Maxwell's armour provides unparalleled
protective qualities at a very affordable price. His unorthodox materials
left the armour with certain shortcomings, but he's yet to have anyone come
back for a refund.
%%%%
mask of the Dragon

A strange blue mask made of hard, flexible leather, resembling a dragon's
visage.
%%%%
robe of Night

A long black robe made of strange glossy material. It seems to shroud its
wearer in darkness. According to legend, it was the gift of Ratri the Goddess
of the Night to one of her followers.
%%%%
armour of the Dragon King

A long time ago, a mighty golden dragon built a kingdom of fire and blood.
Titans and lesser dragons struggled with him in vain — but as with all things,
even he was eventually cast down and undone. Of his life and deeds, this is all
that remains.
%%%%
hat of the Alchemist

A dirty hat. It bears signs of surviving many weird explosions, which suggests
it may have means of protecting the head inside from the risks involved with
alchemy experiments. And with the kind of protections granted by this hat, it's
certain some prior head damage was a prerequisite for even thinking about such
experiments.
%%%%
fencer's gloves

A pair of gloves made of white silk.
%%%%
cloak of Starlight

A phosphorescent cloak, woven of pure light beams.
%%%%
ratskin cloak

An enchantress with a magic loom and way too much time on her hands stitched
this cloak from the hides of hundreds of rats, most of them orange. It's a bit
awkward to wear and looks rather foolish, but it provides excellent protection
from rats of all kinds.
%%%%
shield of the gong

This is a heavy bronze gong that can be worn as a shield. According to certain
mystics, beating on such a gong can grant you spiritual protection.

And this shield will surely be heard!
%%%%
amulet of the Air

This sky-blue amulet must have been given its many protective properties by a
powerful air mage. It seems the one thing they lacked was a steady hand.
%%%%
ring of Shadows

A black ring that can make its wearer one with the shadows. It creates a dark
umbra that surrounds the wearer and increases stealth greatly, and it makes you
and your enemies alike harder to hit.
%%%%
amulet of Cekugob

A strange-looking piece of crystal on an ordinary-looking string, with an odd
selection of powers.
%%%%
amulet of the Four Winds

This pendant, made of purest jade, grants its wearer an immense mystic
strength, sufficient to shrug off all but the most potent of hostile
enchantments.
%%%%
necklace of Bloodlust

Only the crudest of brutes would wear a necklace like this one, made of
bloodstained human and animal teeth, and something that appears to be a piece
of spine.
%%%%
ring of Shaolin

An unadorned jade ring that gives its wearer an uncanny knowledge of one's
body, allowing for impressive feats of dexterity.
%%%%
ring of Robustness

A plain steel ring.
%%%%
ring of the Mage

wearer.

That, and a pony.
%%%%
robe of Clouds

A robe of a material as flimsy and insubstantial as the clouds.
%%%%
hat of Pondering

The favorite hat of the slug wizard Gastronok, stained with reddish slime and
enchanted to aid in his arcane pondering. It has been specially enchanted to
protect against the effects of salt.
%%%%
obsidian axe

This axe has had a curse placed on it by one of the lords of Pandemonium so
that unsuspecting adventurers would unleash demons into this world. Beware, for
this axe has ways of taking its wielder under its command...
%%%%
lightning scales

These scales have been fashioned into armour for a naga's lower body. Faintly
crackling with electricity, they have been enchanted to allow their wearer to
slither at almost a human's pace.
%%%%
Black Knight's horse barding

This barding once protected the steed of the Black Knight during his reign of
terror. It is a heavy coat, made not only of pitch-black steel, but inlaid
with massive plates of black diamond. The weight of metal and stone slows the
steed it protects. It offers more than protection against blows; the adamant
bears an enchantment that makes its wearer partially undead.
%%%%
amulet of Vitality

This famed amulet greatly improves its wearer's health.
%%%%
autumn katana

This exotic sword is a weapon for truly enlightened users.
%%%%
shillelagh "Devastator"

This stick is loaded with more than just lead.
%%%%
dragonskin cloak

This opalescent cloak gleams with all dragon colours. It protects its wearer
from elemental attacks of all kinds, although somewhat unreliably.
%%%%
ring of the Octopus King

“A mermaid who fancied to sing,
 Roused lust in the Octopus King.
 Her squiggly suitor,
 Tried hard to woo her,
 But she couldn't wear all his rings.”
%%%%
Axe of Woe

As you hold this axe your mind does not feel fully your own. Your body begins
to exhibit strength far beyond its capabilities, and your movements become
guided by Makhleb.
%%%%
moon troll leather armour

This armour was reportedly created by enchanting the hide of a now-extinct
species of troll. Whether this armour is truly a remnant of the legendary
unseen terrors of the wind, or merely an appropriation of the name to add
mystique, is itself something of a mystery; its power of rapid regeneration at
the occasional expense of the wearer's magic power, however, is hard to
dispute.
%%%%
macabre finger necklace

This dangling finger would look better with a ring on it.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
boots of the spider

A novel pair of boots invented by a suitor of Arachne.
%%%%
dark maul

This large iron-shod maul is specialised for dealing massively powerful blows.
Alas, such power comes at a price: the maul's head is so heavy it takes forever
to lift it up for another swing.
%%%%
hat of the High Council

A relic of some ancient wizarding war. Centuries later, it still crackles with
effects from the residual hexes and magical energies it was once subjected to
on a daily basis; spellcasters able to get a handle on its power, however, will
find it enhances their spell power.
%%%%
arc blade

A blade somehow crafted from pure electricity. Striking an enemy with it
occasionally unleashes a static discharge.
%%%%
demon whip "Spellbinder"

A weapon said to have once been used to keep unruly imprisoned wizards in line;
it violently disrupts their ability to use magic, inflicting wild and
unpredictable magical effects on those it strikes.
%%%%
lajatang of Order

Long ago Zin bestowed this gift upon a favoured worshipper. It became the
most prized weapon of the many priests of Zin; after their order was destroyed,
it fell into disuse and vanished from history.
%%%%
great mace "Firestarter"

This weapon is imbued with potent fire magic, and fills those it strikes with
inner flame.
%%%%
orange crystal plate armour

Carved from transparent orange crystal, this armour provides remarkable
protection for both mind and body. A skilled user can even channel psychic
energies through the crystal itself. However, it's rather heavy...
%%%%
Majin-Bo

The Majin-Bo is actually a mighty demon, tricked and trapped in this form long
ago. To survive, she now offers tremendous arcane power at a small price: a
tiny portion of the caster’s life essence, taken alongside the magic used every
time its wielder casts a spell. Of course - the demon is more than happy to
suck the life from others, as well.
%%%%
quick blades "Gyre" and "Gimble"

Two quick blades joined by a chain. Swinging one compels the wielder to swing
the other, as if they have minds of their own.
%%%%
