such a weapon, or why, but Xom is probably to blame somehow.

A mighty sword which rewards the powerful with power and the meek with
weakness.
%%%%
staff of Olgreb

Its power depends on the wielder's Evocations skill.

of some enormous predatory creature. It is lethally vampiric, and restores a

A scythe surrounded by an ominous aura of dread. It carries a terrible and
highly irritating curse, which it busily inflicts on both the wielder and their

time it strikes.
%%%%

A massive enchanted cudgel that augments the already considerable strength of
anyone mighty enough to wield it.
%%%%
glaive of the Guard

A glaive commissioned several years ago by a wealthy queen fearful for the
safety of her vast treasury. No foe, the smith promised, could defeat a guard
wielding such a weapon!

It was stolen a few months later, along with the rest of the queen's treasury;
the guard, it transpired, had been caught napping. Still, it should serve more
than adequately in the hands of a waking user.
%%%%
sword of Jihad

A sword made of one huge piece of crystal. Legend says it was the Shining One's
gift to a worshipper. This blade is notorious for inducing bloodthirsty rage in
both the wielder and all of his or her mortal followers.

illuminates the dungeon's recesses, revealing the machinations of those who
would prefer to stay invisible.

possibly from Spriggans. Anyway, it's in some way associated with those fey

causing a range of unpredictable effects — if they survive the impact of the
blade itself, that is.
%%%%
great mace "Undeadhunter"

A weapon imbued with magic to disrupt and destroy the forces binding undead
creatures together. Legends say that, long ago, a lich lord created many
such weapons to ensure the loyalty of his undead servants. Sadly, this mace
might be the last one left.
%%%%

A double-ended whip made from the cured hides of black mambas, and enchanted
with toxins ranging from ordinary venoms to asphyxiating curare.
%%%%

robe of Folly

A dull grey robe. It is enchanted to provide its wearer with immeasurable power
and wisdom, but...

mask of the Dragon

A strange blue mask made of hard, flexible leather, resembling a dragon's
visage.
%%%%

of Ratri the Goddess of the Night to one of her followers.
%%%%
armour of the Dragon King

A suit of armour created from the enchanted scales of a once-mighty king of
dragons. In his time, titans and lesser dragons struggled with him in vain —
but as with all things, even he was eventually cast down and undone. Of his

hat of the Alchemist

A dirty hat. It bears signs of surviving many weird explosions, which suggests
it may have means of protecting the head inside from the risks involved with
alchemy experiments.

A strange-looking piece of crystal on an ordinary-looking string, with an odd

crackling with electricity, they have been enchanted to allow their wearer to
slither at almost a human's pace.

guided by Makhleb.
%%%%
moon troll leather armour

A suit of armour rumoured to have been created by enchanting the hide of a
now-extinct species of troll. Whether the name rings true or is merely
appropriated to add mystique is something of a mystery. The armour's innate
powers of regeneration and magical protection, however, are hard to dispute.

An ugly dangling finger on a string. It would look better with a ring on it.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
boots of the spider

A novel pair of boots invented by a suitor of Arachne.

%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
hat of the High Council

A relic of some ancient wizarding war. Centuries later, it still crackles with

find it enhances the power of their spells.
%%%%
arc blade

A blade somehow crafted from pure electricity. Striking an enemy with it

unpredictable magical effects on those it strikes.

inner flame, and offers protection against the resulting devastation as well
as immunity to clouds of flame.

protection for both mind and body. The wearer can even channel psychic energies
through the crystal itself, enhancing their magical abilities. However, it's
rather heavy...
%%%%
Majin-Bo

A staff inhabited by a mighty demon, tricked and trapped in this form long
ago. To survive, she now offers tremendous arcane power at a small price: a
tiny portion of the caster’s life essence, taken alongside the magic used every
time its wielder casts a spell.
%%%%
pair of quick blades "Gyre" and "Gimble"

Two quick blades joined by a chain. Swinging one compels the wielder to swing
the other, as if they have minds of their own.
%%%%
Maxwell's etheric cage

A fine mesh cage designed to capture magical energy. Experimental notes suggest
that research was abandoned when the cage began to capture magical

their head would find their magic regeneration dramatically increased, at the
cost of multiplying any magical contamination received.
%%%%

A gold crown set with jet-black gems. It permanently afflicts its wearer with
agonising pain, substantially reducing their resilience but rendering them

their wearer, greatly increasing their regeneration, but preventing them from
being healed by potions and wands.

A coat of armour said to have been forged for Queen Kryia in her old age. She
continued to insist on leading her armies from the front even into her dotage,

huge body can wear it.
