another.
%%%%
Mace of Variability

It is rather unreliable.
%%%%
Glaive of Prune

It is the creation of a mad god, and carries a curse which transforms anyone
wielding it into a prune. Fortunately, the curse works very slowly, and one can
use it briefly with no consequences worse than slightly purple skin and a few
wrinkles.
%%%%
Sword of Power

It rewards the powerful with power and the meek with weakness.
%%%%
Staff of Olgreb

This was the magical weapon wielded by the mighty wizard Olgreb before he met
his fate somewhere within these dungeons. It increases the ability of its
wielder to use venomous magic, and carries magical powers which can be evoked.
The tales say that Olgreb researched rare venoms that may have some limited
effect even on creatures immune to all commonly known poisons.
%%%%
Staff of Wucad Mu

It can be evoked to restore large amounts of magical energy, but at the risk of
damaging the user's mind. Its power depends on the wielder's evocations skill.
%%%%
Vampire's Tooth

This ivory-like dagger looks like it could actually have been created from a
tooth of some enormous predatory creature, although obviously not an average
human-sized bloodsucker.

This legendary item can unleash the fury of Hell. The unholy flames it evokes
may cost a portion of your life and your soul, but since when have such details
stopped anyone in their quest for power?
%%%%
Sceptre of Asmodeus

It carries some of the powers of the arch-fiend Asmodeus. Waving this sceptre
can yank powerful hellspawn from their infernal home and enslave them to do
your bidding. Obviously, they're not going to like you when the spell expires.
%%%%
faerie dragon armour

Faerie dragons used to be a race of the same species as mottled ones.
Unfortunately, their vivid colours became their bane, as they alerted potential
prey. They are now extinct, and this prized relic is one of the last proofs
they ever existed.
%%%%
demon blade "Bloodbane"

It carries the bloody taint of an inhuman madman.
%%%%
scimitar of Flaming Death

Smokin'!
%%%%
mace of Brilliance

This mace will let you shine some light into the dungeon, and also will make
sure enemies are well-warned of your presence. Its light is hated by the
undead, and can reveal any machinations of those who try to stay invisible.
%%%%
demon blade "Leech"

It drives its owner's mind into a narrow purpose: gorging on drained life
force.
%%%%
dagger of Chilly Death

A dagger made of one huge piece of sapphire.

%%%%
glaive of the Guard

According to legend he was lost somewhere in the Dungeon.

An adamantine great sword.

A dark and malign artefact. It increases the potency of hexes cast by anyone
unwise enough to risk wielding it.
%%%%
trident of the Octopus King

This trident was stolen many years ago from the Octopus King's garden by a
really unimportant and already dead man. But beware of the Octopus King's
wrath!

killing blow on a strong dragon. The more powerful it grows, the harder it will
be to find a worthy opponent.
%%%%
Spriggan's Knife

A dainty little knife.

This knife was made by Spriggans, or for Spriggans, or possibly from Spriggans.
Anyway, it's in some way associated with those fey folk.
%%%%
plutonium sword

A triple sword made of weird glowing metal. You wonder whether it grew its two
side blades due to its radiation, and whether you'll grow two extra heads as
well.
%%%%
great mace "Undeadhunter"

Legends say that a long time ago, a lich lord experimented with creating
sentient servants instead of mindless automatons. To ensure their loyalty, he
made a number of weapons imbued with magic that could counteract the magic
holding undead together, inflicting great damage.

Although the lich met his end long ago, his weapons, spreading disruption among
the undead, are said to have been popular. At least, old tales are full of
them. However, this mace might be the only one to last — perhaps due to efforts
of the agents of the Shining One, who say that one should not fight necromancy
with necromancy.
%%%%
whip "Snakebite"

A double-ended whip made from the cured hides of the Lair of Beasts' deadly
black mambas.
%%%%

resemble a dragon's visage.

of her followers.

armour of the Dragon King

A long time ago, a mighty golden dragon seized the rulership of all dragons in
his part of the world. Yet his reign didn't last long, stopped by a single puny
human who then made this armour from the dragon's hide.
%%%%
hat of the Alchemist

A dirty hat. It bears signs of surviving many weird explosions, which suggests
it may have means of protecting the head inside from the risks involved with
alchemy experiments. And with the kind of protections granted by this hat, it's
certain some prior head damage was a prerequisite for even thinking about such
experiments.
%%%%
fencer's gloves

A pair of gloves made of white silk.
%%%%
cloak of Starlight

A phosphorescent cloak, woven of pure light beams.
%%%%
ratskin cloak

An enchantress with a magic loom and way too much time on her hands stitched
this cloak from the hides of hundreds of rats, most of them orange. It's a bit
awkward to wear and looks rather foolish, but it provides excellent protection
from rats of all kinds.
%%%%
shield of the gong

This is a large bronze gong that can be worn as a shield. According to certain
mystics, beating on such a gong can grant you spiritual protection.

And this shield surely will be heard!
%%%%
amulet of the Air

body, allowing for impressive feats of dexterity.

protect against the effects of salt, though you probably don't care.
%%%%
obsidian axe

This axe has had a curse placed on it by one of the lords of Pandemonium so
that unsuspecting adventurers like you would unleash demons into this world.
Beware, for this axe has ways of taking its wielder under its command...
%%%%
lightning scales

These scales have been fashioned into armour for a naga's lower body. Faintly
crackling with electricity, they have been enchanted to allow their wearer to
slither at almost a human's pace.
%%%%
Black Knight's horse barding

This gear used to be worn by the personal horse of the Black Knight during his
reign of terror. Pitch-black, it appears to be made not only of some strange
black steel, but also of entire plates of black diamond! Naturally, such a
weight of metal and stone cannot be good for the mount's speed. However, it
offers not only mundane protection against blows; the adamant bears an
enchantment that makes its wearer partially undead.
%%%%
ring of Vitality

This famed ring greatly improves its wearer's health.
%%%%
autumn katana

This exotic sword is a weapon for truly enlightened users.
%%%%
shillelagh "Devastator"

You guess this stick is loaded with something more than just lead.
%%%%
dragonskin cloak

This opalescent cloak gleams with all dragon colours. It protects its wearer
from elemental attacks of all kinds, although somewhat unreliably.
%%%%
ring of the Octopus King

"A mermaid who fancied to sing,
 Roused lust in the Octopus King.
 Her squiggly suitor,
 Tried hard to woo her,
 But she couldn't wear all his rings."
%%%%
Axe of Woe

As you hold this axe your mind does not feel fully your own. Your body begins
to exhibit strength far beyond its capabilities, and your movements become
guided by Makhleb.
%%%%
moon troll leather armour

This armour was reportedly created by enchanting the hide of a now-extinct
species of troll. Whether this armour is truly a remnant of the legendary
unseen terrors of the wind or merely an appropriation of the name to add
mystique is something of a mystery; its power of rapid regeneration at the
occasional expense of the wearer's magic power, however, is hard to dispute.
%%%%
macabre finger necklace

This dangling finger would look better with a ring on it.
%%%%
boots of Ultimate Suction

A novel pair of boots invented by a suitor of Arachne.
%%%%
milk chocolate

This item is a debugging aid, granting a vast array of mostly beneficial
artefact properties.

If you see this in a real game, it's a bug.

dark chocolate

This item is a debugging aid, granting a vast array of mostly harmful artefact
properties. It's distinct from its milky counterpart as some props conflict
with each other.

If you see this in a real game, it's a bug.
