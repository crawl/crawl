Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it
is the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped
by all kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No
matter what the origin of this cave is, it is filled with riches unheard of
as well as with ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and
even fewer have kept some rest of sanity to tell the tale.

The dungeon is 27 levels deep but honestly, this is only the beginning.
%%%%
Temple

The Temple of some of the Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the
insanity of the dungeon. It is located between the levels 4 and 7 of
the main dungeon.
%%%%
Orcish Mines

The mines of the orcs, filled with their gold, but treacherous and easy to
get trapped in.

The Orcish Mines are four levels deep and contain the entrance to the Elven
Halls.
%%%%
Elven Halls

Whereas most elven folk would never move into a dark subterranean complex
like this, the deep elves did. Their halls are filled with riches but any
passersby should be aware of the legendary magical prowess of this species.

The Elven Halls are seven levels deep.
%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the lair to be an exciting change of climate. And
indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and
eaten rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.

The Lair is ten levels deep and contains the stairs to three more branches.
%%%%
Swamp

A swampy waste land, complete with ooze, muck, flies and large slavering
carnivorous monsters.

The Swamp is five levels deep and contains the decaying rune. A dungeon
features only one of the Swamp or Shoals branches. If the Swamp is
present, the entry is located between Lair:2 and Lair:7.
%%%%
Shoals

From afar you hear the steady sounds of waves and smell the salty spray.
Upon reaching the Shoals, you are impressed by exotic underground beaches,
making up a few islands in a vast sea. Out of a sudden, a bloodcurdling
scream fills the air, followed by a gurgle. Anxiously, you look around and
wonder: who is the predator? And who is the prey?

The Shoals are five levels deep and contain the barnacled rune. A dungeon
features only one of the Swamp or Shoals branches. If the Shoals are
present, the entry is located between Lair:2 and Lair:7.
%%%%
Slime Pits

The amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Any trace of intelligent
beings has long been dissolved. Still, there are rumours of great treasures
deep down, hidden safely away in secret chambers without door or window for
acid to leak in.

The Slime Pits are six levels deep and contain the slimy rune. The entry is
between Lair:8 and Lair:10.
%%%%
Snake Pit

Home of the serpent, lair of the naga.

entry is between Lair:3 and Lair:8.
%%%%
Hive

You hear a many-fold buzzing.

The Hive is two levels deep. The entry is located between dungeon levels
11 and 16.
%%%%
Vaults

Possibly constructed by some powerful madman, the vaults are said to be home
to great treasures. The blood spots all around the entrance indicate that
there is a certain amount of violence, too.

The Vaults are eight levels deep and contain the silver rune. The entrance
can be found between levels 14 and 19 of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Hall of Blades

Once upon a time, all the daggers and axes and polearms would gather at the
time of night and dance the waltz, dreaming of battlefields void of man and
beast. That time is no more, yet the weapons are still there.

The Hall of Blades is a single level and can be found between Vaults:4 and
Vaults:6.
%%%%
Crypt

You hear moans and shrieks of tortured souls, suffering in acts of the
unspeakable.

The Crypt is five levels deep and can be found between Vaults:2 and Vaults:4.
%%%%
Tomb

The Tomb of the Ancients, a place of damnation, of horrors animated
by the vilest necromancy.

The Tomb is three levels deep and contains the golden rune. Its entry is
either on Crypt:2 or Crypt:3.
%%%%
Hell

The hallway to the four hells is guarded by Geryon. Heroes who prove their
worth in the vestibule and blow Geryon's horn may explore the different
regions of Hell: Dis, Gehenna, Cocytus and Tartarus.

Portals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the deeper parts
of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Dis

Who will stand the test of iron?

Dis is seven levels deep and contains the iron rune. It can be accessed via
the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Gehenna

The fires of Gehenna burnt many a confident hero, and they will burn
evermore.

accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.

A grim and frost-bitten hell.

Over time, the undead, demons and devils of this place drain all life out of
treasure-craving visitors.

via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Pan

Pandemonium, colloquially known as Pan, is an infinite realm of pain and
suffering. Pan contains four special runes, as well as generic ones, in
addition to lots of loot. All these treasures are guarded by demons and
cruel Pan lords. Many a hero, confusing confidence with megalomania, has
died unsuspectingly in the barrage of torment and hellfire.

Pan is endless.
%%%%
Abyss

The Abyss is a truly bizarre place, everchanging and twisted. It is filled
with all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature, whose common aim is
to feast on intruders. It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who
delight in sending would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of
madness. Reportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems
to concoct schemes around this place and its denizens.

The Abyss can be purposefully reached through portals in the deeper levels
of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Zot

A region of the dungeon complex, safely locked away and referred to usually
by madness, frenzy, lunacy. Only the most demented adventurers would dare to
break the seal and press deeper - in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no
man has ever laid eyes on before.

Zot is five levels deep and can only be entered when carrying three runes.
