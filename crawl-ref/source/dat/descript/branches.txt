Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it is
the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped by all
kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No matter what
the origin of this cave is, it is filled with riches unheard of as well as with
ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and even fewer have kept
some sliver of sanity to tell the tale.

The dungeon is 27 levels deep, but, honestly, this is only the beginning.
%%%%
Temple

A Temple of Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the insanity of the dungeon.
It is located between the levels 4 and 7 of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Orcish Mines

The mines of the orcs, filled with their gold, but treacherous and easy to get
trapped in.

The Orcish Mines are four levels deep and contain the entrance to the Elven
Halls.
%%%%
Elven Halls

Whereas most elven folk would never move into a dark subterranean complex like
this, the deep elves did. Their halls are filled with riches, but any
passers-by should be aware of the legendary magical prowess of this species.

The Elven Halls are three levels deep.
%%%%
Dwarven Hall

These halls of finely worked stone are the dwelling of the Deep Dwarves. Their
fine metalworking skills allowed them to forge enough weapons against the likes
of you.

It is but a single level.
%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the Lair of Beasts to be an exciting change of climate.
And indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and eaten
rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.

The Lair is eight levels deep and contains the stairs to three more branches.
%%%%
Swamp

A swampy wasteland, complete with ooze, muck, flies and large slavering
carnivorous monsters.

The Swamp is five levels deep and contains the decaying rune. A dungeon
features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches. If
the Swamp is present, the entrance is located between Lair:2 and Lair:5.
%%%%
Shoals

From afar you hear the steady sounds of waves and smell the salty spray. Upon
reaching the Shoals, you are impressed by exotic underground beaches, making up
a few islands in a vast sea. All of a sudden, a bloodcurdling scream fills the
air, followed by a gurgle. Anxiously, you look around and wonder: Who is the
predator? And who is the prey?

The Shoals are five levels deep and contain the barnacled rune. A dungeon
features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches. If
the Shoals are present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Snake Pit

Home of the serpent, lair of the naga.

The Snake Pit is five levels deep and contains the serpentine rune. A dungeon
features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches. If
the Snake Pit is present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Spider Nest

And you think you'll just wield a shoe and be done? If you don't have
arachnophobia yet, you will soon.

The Spider Nest is five levels deep and contains the gossamer rune. A dungeon
features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches. If
the Spider Nest is present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Slime Pits

The amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Any trace of intelligent
beings has long been dissolved. Still, there are rumours of great treasures
deep down, hidden safely away in secret chambers without door or window for
acid to leak in.

The Slime Pits are six levels deep and contain the slimy rune. The entry is
between Lair:6 and Lair:8.
%%%%
Vaults

Possibly constructed by some powerful madman, the Vaults are said to be home to
great treasures. The blood spots all around the entrance indicate that there is
a certain amount of violence, too.

The Vaults are eight levels deep and contain the silver rune. The entrance can
be found between levels 14 and 19 of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Hall of Blades

Once upon a time, all the daggers and axes and polearms would gather at the
time of night and dance the waltz, dreaming of battlefields void of man and
beast. That time is no more, yet the weapons are still there.

The Hall of Blades is a single level and can be found between Vault:4 and
Vault:6.
%%%%
Crypt

You hear moans and shrieks of tortured souls, suffering in acts of the
unspeakable.

The Crypt is five levels deep and can be found between Vault:2 and Vault:4.
%%%%
Tomb

The Tomb of the Ancients, a place of damnation, of horrors animated by the
vilest necromancy.

The Tomb is three levels deep and contains the golden rune. Its entry is either
on Crypt:2 or Crypt:3.
%%%%
Hell

The hallway to the four hells is guarded by Geryon. Heroes who prove their
worth in the vestibule and blow Geryon's horn may explore the different regions
of Hell: Dis, Gehenna, Cocytus and Tartarus.

Portals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the deeper parts of
the main dungeon.
%%%%
Dis

The Iron City of Dis. Who will stand the test of iron?

Dis is seven levels deep and contains the iron rune. It can be accessed via the
Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Gehenna

The fires of Gehenna burnt many a confident hero, and they will burn evermore.

Gehenna is seven levels deep and contains the obsidian rune. It can be accessed
via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Cocytus

A grim and frost-bitten wasteland.

Cocytus is seven levels deep and contains the icy rune. It can be accessed via
the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Tartarus

A decaying netherworld. Over time, the undead, demons and devils of this place
drain all life out of treasure-craving visitors.

Tartarus is seven levels deep and contains the bone rune. It can be accessed
via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Zot

A region of the dungeon complex, safely locked away and referred to usually by
madness, frenzy, lunacy. Only the most demented adventurers would dare to break
the seal and press deeper - in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no one has
ever laid eyes on before.

The Realm of Zot is five levels deep and can only be entered when carrying at
least three runes.
%%%%
Forest

Tha trees be attackin'!
%%%%
Abyss

The Abyss is a truly bizarre place, ever-changing and twisted. It is filled
with all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature, whose common aim is to
feast on intruders. It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who delight
in sending would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of madness.
Reportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems to concoct
schemes around this place and its denizens.

The abyssal rune can be found there. The Abyss can be purposefully reached
through portals in the deeper levels of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Pandemonium

Pandemonium is an infinite realm of pain and suffering. While you can find a
good deal of loot there, all these treasures are guarded by demons and even
crueller demon lords. Many a hero, confusing confidence with megalomania, has
died unsuspectingly in the barrage of torment and hellfire.

Pandemonium is endless. Portals there are found abundantly in the deeper parts
of the main dungeon. Note that getting back might be more difficult.

You can find no less than five runes in the Pandemonium:
 • fiery in the well-heated realm of Cerebov
 • glowing in the radioactive domain on Mnoleg
 • magical is guarded by arcane powers of Lom Lobon and his minions
 • dark lies in the shadowy dwelling of Gloorx Vloq
 • demonic runes exist in multiple copies, owned by less famous lords
%%%%
Ziggurat

A series of arenas, each containing greater wealth and even greater danger than
the last. Whatever entity created this monstrosity charges a steep price for
entry. Beware, for a ziggurat is not a place for the faint of heart: even the
bravest and most skilled adventurers have met their ends in one. While a portal
to safety will be present on every level, once left, a ziggurat cannot be
reentered.
%%%%
Labyrinth

The Labyrinth is a vast and complex maze designed by subtle and malicious minds
for reasons long lost to history. Old stories say that the labyrinth was
constructed as a prison for a fearsome minotaur. More recent stories say this
beast dwells there still, guarding the labyrinth's sole exit — as well as a
hoard of treasure taken from the bodies of the foolish adventurers who got lost
inside and starved to death. Take care inside the shifting, twisting passages
of this labyrinth, or your own possessions may end up in the minotaur's
treasure pile.
%%%%
Bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the
dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by traveling from place to
place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better stock
than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain.

Also, be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to
appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave quickly,
probably to sell them elsewhere.
%%%%
Trove

Once upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard, terrified of being caught
committing an act of burglary, created a system of portals leading into the
secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich. Too scared to loot them
himself, he instead charged an extortionate fee for entry to anyone who wanted
to rifle through them. A clever artificer, he designed his portals to direct
the entrant to the trove most suited to their needs.

The items inside this trove are likely to be useful, but beware: the wizard is
long dead, and even while alive he never offered a money-back guarantee.
%%%%
Sewer

Every settlement brings forth the unpleasant sewers and drains, ignored by most
but hideaways for others. Old tales speak of dangerous creatures, bathing in
disgusting-smelling green water, preying on each other without mercy. The tales
also allude to valuable items left by daring and unfortunate visitors, left to
grow mildew in the damp caverns.
%%%%
Ossuary

A small tomb, containing the remains of some distant relatives of the pharaohs.
It is undoubtedly home to many traps, and its denizens are unlikely to take
kindly to looting.
%%%%
Bailey

The castle of some lord. It is undoubtedly protected by physical barriers and
well-trained soldiers.
%%%%
Ice Cave

A desolate, echo-filled cavern shaped from solid ice. The intricate carvings
and statues which once lined its walls have been warped and obscured by
centuries of slow melting and refreezing.
%%%%
Volcano

Built from enormous blocks of obsidian, this sweltering chamber may once have
served as a temple to some strange deity, or perhaps the dwelling of a mighty
fire giant. The air shimmers with oppressive heat, and the dull roar of the
volcano's heart never ceases.
%%%%
Wizlab

The laboratory of some wizard, the portal to which has been carelessly left
open. Beware, for wizards love to guard their possessions with traps and
monsters of their own making!
%%%%
Hive

You hear a manifold buzzing.
%%%%
