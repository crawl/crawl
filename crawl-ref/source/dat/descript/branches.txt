Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it is
the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped by all
kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light.
No matter what the origin of this cave is, it is filled with riches unheard of 
as well as with ample dangers to any intruder.
Few have escaped alive, and even fewer have kept some rest of sanity to tell
the tale.
%%%%
Temple

The Temple of some of the Gods, a place of peace and refuge
from the insanity of the dungeon.
%%%%
Orcish Mines

The mines of the orcs, filled with their gold, but 
treacherous and easy to get trapped in.
%%%%
Elven Halls

Whereas most elven folk would never move into a dark subterranean complex like
this, the deep elves did. Their halls are filled with riches but any passersby
should be aware of the legendary magical prowess of this species.
%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the lair to be an exciting change of climate. And
indeed, there is something to be said about getting stabbed, mauled and 
eaten rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.
%%%%
Swamp

A swampy waste land, complete with ooze, muck, flies, and
large slavering carnivorous monsters.
%%%%
Shoals

Here be the Shoals: exotic underground beaches, salty spray and
creatures that bite, stab, and maul.
%%%%
Slime Pits

The amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. 
Any trace of intelligent beings has long been dissolved. Still, 
there are rumours of great treasures deep down, hidden safely away
in secret chambers without door or window for acid to leak in.
%%%%
Snake Pit

Home of the serpent, lair of the naga.
%%%%
Hive

You hear a many-fold buzzing. 
%%%%
Vaults

Possibly constructed by some powerful madman, the vaults are said to be home
to great treasures. The blood spots all around the entrance indicate that
there is a certain amount of violence, too.
%%%%
Hall of Blades

Once upon a time, all the daggers and axes and polearms would gather at the
time of night and dance the waltz, dreaming of battlefields void of man and
beast. That time is no more yet the weapons are still there.
%%%%
Crypt

You hear moans and shrieks of tortured souls, suffering in acts of the
unspeakable.
%%%%
Tomb

The Tomb of the Ancients, a place of damnation, of horrors animated 
by the vilest necromancy.

"In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though
the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their
existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But
sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung
wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive
sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror,
imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or
controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the
brotherhood of remorse not break their chain."
    -Nathaniel Hawthorne
%%%%
Hell

The hallway to the four hells, guarded by Geryon.
%%%%
Dis

Who will stand the test of iron?
%%%%
Gehenna

The fires of Gehenna burnt many a confident hero, and they will burn evermore.
%%%%
Cocytus

A grim and frost-bitten hell.
%%%%
Tartarus

Over time, the undead, demons and devils of this place drain all life out of 
treasure-craving visitors.
%%%%
Zot

A region of the dungeon complex, safely locked away and referred to usually by
madness, frenzy, lunacy. Only the most demented adventurers would dare to
break the seal and press deeper -- in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no 
man has ever laid eyes on before.
