%%%%
Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it is
the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped by all
kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No matter what
its origin, this deep cavern is filled with riches unheard of as well as with
ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and even fewer have kept
some sliver of sanity sufficient to tell the tale.
%%%%
Temple

The Ecumenical Temple is a place of peace and refuge from the insanity of the
dungeon. It usually contains altars to most of the known gods. Gods that value
exploration grant no piety for exploring the Temple.
%%%%
Orcish Mines

The Orcish Mines are filled with the cave orcs native to the Dungeon, their
humanoid labourers, and piles of freshly mined gold. Enterprising merchants
have set up trading posts to help relieve the orcs of the latter.
%%%%
Elven Halls

The Elven Halls are home to the deep elves, a race that turned their backs on
the sun long ago. Their halls are filled with riches, but a deadly welcome
awaits any would-be robbers. In their long seclusion, the deep elves have
perfected dark sorceries of a power the orcs can only dream of!
%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the Lair of Beasts to be an exciting change of climate.
And indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and eaten
rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.

The Lair contains the entrances to one of the Swamp or the Shoals, one of the
Snake Pit or the Spider Nest, and to the Pits of Slime.
%%%%
Swamp

A swampy wasteland, the Swamp is filled with ooze, muck, flies and large
slavering carnivorous monsters.

A dungeon features only one of the Swamp and Shoals branches.
%%%%
Shoals

The exotic underground beaches of the Shoals make up a few small islands in a
seemingly endless sea. The merfolk have made it their home, alongside many
dreaded sea creatures.

A dungeon features only one of the Shoals and Swamp branches.
%%%%
Snake Pit

The corridors of the Snake Pit are home to all varieties of serpent, and are
inhabited by a society of powerful nagas and salamanders.

A dungeon features only one of the Snake Pit and Spider Nest branches.
%%%%
Spider Nest

The crumbling, web-choked caverns of the Spider Nest are packed with poisonous
arthropods and assorted creepy-crawlies.

A dungeon features only one of the Spider Nest and Snake Pit branches.
%%%%
Slime Pits

The Slime Pits are the amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Even the
walls drip with painful acid. Any trace of intelligent beings has long been
dissolved. Still, there are rumours of great treasures deep down, hidden safely
away in secret chambers without any entrance.
%%%%
Vaults

Possibly constructed by some powerful tyrant, the Vaults are said to be home to
great treasures. The blood spattered liberally around the entrance suggests
that there is a certain amount of violence, too.
%%%%
Crypt

The Crypt is a huge repository for the ancient dead. The air is chill and
fetid, the walls cold and damp. Bones are strewn liberally everywhere, and
every noise echoes worryingly, violating the overbearing silence of the grave.
%%%%
Tomb

The Tomb of the Ancients is a place of damnation, of horrors animated by the
vilest necromancy. The list of those who have returned from this place of pure
death is exceedingly short.
%%%%
Hell

The Vestibule of Hell is guarded by Geryon, along with various denizens of
each of the hells themselves.

Portals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the Depths.
%%%%
Dis

The Iron City of Dis is home to many of the most resilient guardians of hell.
Those who do not belong in the halls of Dis will find the very earth itself
opposing them.

The malice of this metal realm corrodes equipment.
%%%%
Gehenna

Gehenna is a realm of lava, flames and damnation. Those who linger will have
fire and brimstone rained down upon them.

The acrid smoke renders scrolls unreadable.
%%%%
Cocytus

Cocytus is a grim and frost-bitten wasteland. Intruders will find the biting
winds and icy inhabitants of the wastes impeding their progress.

The frigid cold congeals potions.
%%%%
Tartarus

Tartarus is a decaying netherworld. Over time, the undead, demons and devils of
this place drain the life from any who dare to enter.

The all-pervading rot saps visitors' willpower.
%%%%
Zot

The Realm of Zot is a region of the dungeon that is so terrifying, so full of
madness, frenzy and lunacy, that it has been locked securely against random
trespassers. Only the most demented adventurers would dare gather the required
keys, break the seal and penetrate deeper — all in the vain hope for a fabled
artefact no one has ever laid eyes on before.
%%%%
Abyss

The Abyss is a truly bizarre place, ever-changing and twisted. It is filled
with all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature, whose common aim is to
feast on intruders. It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who delight
in sending would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of madness.
Reportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems to concoct
schemes around this place and its denizens.

Portals to the Abyss are found abundantly in the Depths.

The Abyss consists of seven infinite levels. The abyssal rune of Zot can be
found from the third level onwards, and is more common at greater depths.
Portals back to the dungeon are scattered throughout the Abyss, and are found
more commonly at greater depths or while carrying the abyssal rune.

Adventurers who linger in the Abyss will find themselves drawn irresistibly
deeper. Killing monsters will warp the substance of the Abyss, eventually
generating a gateway out. Further persistence will wear holes in the Abyss,
allowing descent into deeper layers. The Abyss remembers its visitors - once
an adventurer has entered a level, future visits to the Abyss will always
take them at least that far down.
%%%%
Pandemonium

Pandemonium is an infinite realm of pain and suffering. While there are many
treasures to be found within, they are guarded by cruel demons and even
crueller demon lords.

Portals to Pandemonium are found abundantly in the Depths.

Pandemonium is endless. Each area of Pandemonium has a small chance of
containing a portal back to the dungeon, either directly or via the Abyss.

No fewer than five runes of Zot can be found in Pandemonium:
 • the fiery rune resides in the blazing realm of Cerebov
 • the glowing rune can be found in the contaminated domain of Mnoleg
 • the magical rune is guarded by the arcane powers of Lom Lobon
 • the dark rune is hidden in the shadowy abode of Gloorx Vloq
 • the demonic rune exists in multiple places, owned by less famous lords
%%%%
Ziggurat

A ziggurat is a strange tower constructed of incrementally larger combat
arenas, each containing greater wealth and even greater danger than the last.
Beware, for a ziggurat is not a place for the faint of heart: even the bravest
and most skilled adventurers have met their ends in one. While a portal to
safety will be present on every level, once left, a ziggurat cannot be
re-entered.

One ziggurat is guaranteed in the Depths. Tales tell of a magical item found
at the bottom of each ziggurat, granting access to a new ziggurat in turn. Such
an item is also said to be found at the bottom of the Tomb of the Ancients. Each
time a ziggurat is conquered by exiting it from the final floor, subsequent
ziggurats will become increasingly dangerous and lucrative.
%%%%
Gauntlet

An elaborate complex designed to lure foolhardy adventurers seeking riches and
glory. Those who enter must choose a path through several combat arenas, each
of which contains treasure guarded by dangerous and sometimes exotic creatures.
At the end awaits a fearsome minotaur, guarding a large hoard of loot taken from
the bodies of foolish adventurers.

Long-range teleports are impossible in Gauntlets.
%%%%
Bazaar

While some merchants set up shop in the dungeon, others travel in caravans from
place to place. The bazaars of these itinerant traders feature a number of
different shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes
even at a bargain.
%%%%
Trove

Once upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard created a system of portals
leading into the secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich. Too scared to
loot them himself, he instead charged an extortionate fee for entry to anyone
who wanted to rifle through them.

The items inside such troves are likely to be useful, but beware: the wizard is
long dead, and even while alive he never offered a money-back guarantee.
%%%%
Sewer

Every inhabited place needs to dispose of its waste products. The Dungeon too
has its stinking sewers and drains, full of filthy water and ignored by most
but used as hideaways by the disgusting and the desperate. Old tales speak of
dangerous creatures stalking through the foul-smelling green water, preying on
each other without mercy. The tales also allude to valuable items accidentally
washed into the drainage tunnels, forgotten and left to grow mouldy in the damp
caverns.
%%%%
Ossuary

The ossuary is a small tomb containing the remains and grave goods of some
distant relatives of the pharaohs, along with the corpses of their retainers
and household animals. It is undoubtedly riddled with many traps, and its
undead denizens are unlikely to take kindly to looting.
%%%%
Bailey

The bailey is the still-occupied and well-guarded fortress of an orcish lord.
The treasures within are protected by both physical barriers and large numbers
of well-armed humanoid warriors.
%%%%
Ice Cave

The {{ if you.branch() == "Elf" or you.branch() == "Swamp" or
you.branch() == "Snake" or you.branch() == "Shoals" or you.branch() == "Spider"
then return "glacial chasm"; else return "ice cave"; end }} is a desolate cavern
shaped from solid ice and filled with the echoes of bestial howls. The intricate
carvings and statues which once lined its walls have been warped and obscured by
centuries of slow melting and refreezing.
%%%%
Volcano

Built from enormous blocks of obsidian, the volcano's sweltering chambers may
once have served as a temple to some strange deity, or perhaps the dwelling of
a mighty fire giant. The air shimmers with oppressive heat, and the dull roar
of the volcano's heart never ceases.
%%%%
Wizlab

In ages past, the most powerful mages would frequently find or construct small
realms sealed off from the rest of the world, where they could isolate
themselves in the pursuit of ever-greater magical knowledge and power. The
mages are long gone, but many of their arcane laboratories still exist, filled
with the results of their experiments. Those willing to explore these
laboratories may find powerful magical treasures, but be warned: any wizard
capable of constructing such a realm deserved their reputation.
%%%%
Depths

The Depths are the deepest part of the dungeon proper, subject to the
corrupting influence of the Realm of Zot without being considered a part of it.
%%%%
Desolation

The Desolation was once ruled by the divines Sheza and Sargol. After the dread
twins were cast down, the good gods reduced their former realm to salt, that
such a terrible cult would never rise again. Amidst the ruins, only the last
cultists of the dead gods, their heretical constructs, and the guardians
of the cult's legendary treasure yet remain.

# important note: the Twins were religion '2', as TSO is '1'. Not 'S'.
%%%%
Arena

Okawaru's most favoured followers are granted access to the Arena to duel
against their foes.
%%%%
Crucible

The Crucible of Flesh is an infernal pit where Makhleb's most devoted and
detested alike are made to sanctify themselves in blood. No sane mortal would
ever choose to come here, and yet even victims of the Destroyer's greatest ire
may be granted passage out once more, should they mete out mutilation equal to
the demonic torturers of this realm.
