Tomb

"In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though
the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their
existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But
sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung
wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive
sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror,
imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or
controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the
brotherhood of remorse not break their chain."

%%%%
A granite statue

"I met a traveller from an antique land
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
 Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
 Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown
 And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
 Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,
 The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
 And on the pedestal these words appear:
 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
 Nothing beside remains: round the decay
 Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
 The lone and level sands stretch far away."
    -Percy Bysshe Shelley, "Ozymandias".  1818.

A labyrinth entrance

"Maze-treaders, whose vision ahead and behind is severely constricted and fragmented, suffer confusion, whereas maze-viewers who see the pattern whole, from above or in a diagram, are dazzled by its complex artistry. What you see depends on where you stand, and thus, at one and the same time, labyrinths are single (there is one physical structure) and double: they simultaneously incorporate order and disorder, clarity and confusion, unity and multiplicity, artistry and chaos."

it is frequently to be seen in the London fruit shops."

     in linen cloth, lying there many centuries;
 I look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping
     neck, the hands folded across the breast."

 And the music softly moans

 And dance around in your bones.

 And you can’t get ice cream cones
 T'ain't no sin to take off your skin
 And dance around your bones."
