# As of Stone Soup 0.3 the previously hardcoded monster 
# speech has been outsourced. This makes changing existing 
# messages, and adding new ones really easy.
#
# shout.txt holds the utterances (and visual equivalents) of
# monsters that notice you.
#
# For an explanation of how to read shout.txt and speak.txt 
# and how to add new messages, see monster_speech.txt in the
# docs directory.
