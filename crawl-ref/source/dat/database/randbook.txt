# Randart Names
# -------------
# randbook.txt: keywords for randart BOOKS
#
# This file contains the lists of keywords (and their
# weights) for most of the keywords used for randart
# books.
# There are two types of randart books:
#  - fixed theme, varying level (Conjurations, Summoning/Earth, ...)
#  - fixed level, varying theme (level 2 spells etc.)
#
# The books are filled with spells matching their type in spl-book.cc,
# either make_book_theme_randart() or make_book_level_randart().
# The name should likewise take into account the book's type.
#
# Themed books use one of the following two naming schemes:
#   a) @book_name@ @<secondary school> adj@ @<primary school>@
#   b) @book_name@ @<primary school>@ and @<secondary school>@
#
# or, if there is no (obvious) secondary school, simply:
#
#   @book_name@ @<primary school>@
#
# Fixed level books are categorized into "easy" (level 1-3),
# "moderate" (level 4-6) and "difficult" (level 7-9), a keyword that is
# used as a prefix for "level book".
#
# See the explanation in the main file, randname.txt, for more general
# information on randart naming.

# Book name should be set in make_book_level_randart() or
# make_book_theme_randart(), so if this gets picked there's a bug.
