<h>Item letters</h>
Pressing an item type's letter key selects that item.

<h>Selecting item types</h>
Items types displayed in grey use the default autopickup options set in your
configuration file. Selecting a type of item overrides those options
(indicated by <w>white</w> text), and toggles the item between the states:
 <w>+</w>  Items of this type will be picked up automatically.

stash-search.prompt

<h>Searching the stash-tracker</h>

You can search for items and dungeon features by name (or a substring of the
name). In the list of search results, you can select a search result by its
hotkey to travel to its location.

Some examples of search strings:
<w>cure mutation</w> find all potions of cure mutation, including potions in shops.
<w>jelly</w>         finds every single royal jelly and heaps of royal jellies.
<w>shop</w>          lists all shops. Press <w>?</w> and a shop's letter for the stock.
<w>Lair:2</w>        find everything known to be on Lair:2.
<w>D:[2-4]</w>       finds everything on Dungeon levels 2-4. Regexes are allowed!
              Note that D:[3-10] will not work as intended, since [x-y] is a
              regex character range.
<w>\+3</w>           finds all items with a +3 enchantment
<w>rC\+\+</w>        finds all items with an rC++ resistance. Note with these that
              the + symbol had to be escaped as \+ due to Regex syntax.
<w>Lair.*axe</w> and <w>axe && Lair</w> both show all axes in the Lair.

Some shortcuts:
<w>.</w>             lists everything on your current level.
<w>..</w>            lists all items you know.
<w>0</w> to <w>9</w>        lists all items at the specified waypoint.
<w>*</w>             lists all items at all waypoints.
<w>@(pattern)</w>    lists everything matching (pattern) on your current level.

You can also examine shops and items in the search results by pressing <w>?</w> and
then hitting the hotkey for the search result. This will give a description
of the item or the contents of the shop.

The stash search string is case-insensitive.

<h>Searching by item properties:</h>

You can search for spell names (such as <w>Ignite Poison</w>) to find spellbooks
or rods that contain the spell.

You can search for artefact item properties (such as <w>prevents.*teleport</w>)
to find artefacts that have the property.

You can also search by some additional item properties: <w>artefact</w> or
<w>artifact</w> will find identified artefacts, <w>ego</w> or <w>branded</w> will
find non-artefacts with a brand and unidentified items which may be
branded, <w>throwable</w> will find things you can throw, <w>stick</w> will
find items that can be used with Sticks to Snakes, and <w>dropped</w> will
find items you have dropped.

Skill names (such as <w>Polearms</w> or <w>Long Blades</w>) will find all
weapons that train that skill.

You can also search by item types such as <w>book</w> or <w>jewellery</w>. For
armour slots, you can use <w>helmet</w> (all head gear), <w>gloves</w>,
<w>shield</w>, and <w>body</w>.

<h>Finding Dungeon Features:</h>

You can search for dungeon features by name: all shops will be found by a
search for <w>shop</w> (including shops that do not have "shop" in their name);
other dungeon features can also be found by name: <w>fountain</w>, <w>spear trap</w>,
<w>altar</w>, etc. You can also search for altars by deity name: <w>Zin</w>.

<h>Non-regex operators:</h>

You can use !! to negate a search string, && for a boolean AND, || for
boolean OR, and <<<< >> for grouping.

For instance, to find rings (jewellery) but not ring mail you could use:
<w>ring && !!mail</w>

skill-menu

                               <h>Skill management</h>
You gain experience for killing monsters (and very few other activities).
This experience is used to train skills. The skill screen allows you to
select which skills to train. Note that you train all activated skills at
once whenever you gain some experience. It is not a bug if you gain a skill
level in Axes after killing a monster with a spell.
A skill can only be trained if there's some available means of exercising it;
see "Training restrictions" below for details.

By pressing its letter, you can cycle if and how a skill is trained:
<darkgrey>- deselected</darkgrey>    Skill will not train at all.
+ selected
<w>* focused</w>       Skill will train faster than others.

Pressing a capital letter selects that skill and deselects all the others.
This shortcut is useful when you want to train only one skill.

Training can be done in two modes, which are toggled with the <w>/</w> key.
* automatic:    Skills are trained based on your use of them.
* manual:       Experience is spread evenly across all activated skills.

How fast you train a skill is governed by the following factors:
* aptitude: Shown <white>white</white> in the Apt column. Higher numbers mean that
      less experience is needed to advance a skill. Depends on species.
* cross-training: Some skills are easier to learn when you already are
      proficient with a related one, e.g. Long and Short Blades.
      The aptitude bonus for crosstraining is indicated in <green>green</green>.
* magic penalties: It is harder to learn an elemental skill if you are
      proficient in the opposing element (Air-Earth, Ice-Fire).
      The aptitude penalty is indicated in <red>red</red>.

On top of that, there are some effects which directly modify a skill, for
example draining or some god powers. Reduced skills are shown in <magenta>magenta</magenta>, and
enhanced skills in <blue>blue</blue>.
The training percentage (in <brown>brown</brown>) shows the relative
amount of experience which will be used to train this skill.

Apart from (de)selecting skills, you also have the following toggles:
<w>/</w> :   Switch between automatic and manual training.
<w>*</w> :   Shows all skills, even those you can't train yet.
<w>?</w> :   Allows you to read the descriptions of skills.
<w>_</w> :   Shows/hides skill modifiers, e.g. from god powers.

                               <h>Training restrictions</h>
Fighting, Throwing, Armour, Dodging, Stealth, Unarmed Combat, and Spellcasting
can always be trained. For the rest:
* Weapon skills require carrying a weapon of the appropriate type.
* Shields requires that you either be wearing a shield, or have the capacity
      to obtain one through magical or divine means.
* Evocations requires carrying an evocable item, or having a Nemelex ability.
* Spell schools require knowing a spell of the school.
* Necromancy can also be trained when having a Kikubaaqudgha ability.
* Invocations requires having at least one divine ability that exercises it.
