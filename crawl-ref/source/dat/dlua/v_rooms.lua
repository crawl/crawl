-- Attempts to place a room by picking a random available spot and checking it'll fit.
-- GENERAL TODO:
-- 1. This function is massive and could do with breaking up into a few parts (calculate normals; check space / generate coords; paint and set usage)
-- 2. Open room placement is slow. When we place an open room we should set ineligible squares all around it (at e.g. 2 tiles distance). This will reduce
--    attempts to place overlapping rooms and reduce the overall number of 'open' spots, meaning we get increasingly more likely to hit an 'eligible_open' instead.
--    These new restricted zones still need to reference the room so they don't stop proper attachment of new rooms.
-- 3. Funny-shaped rooms can still produce VETO-causing bubbles even with all this checking, this can typically happen when two funny-shaped rooms connect
--    via two separate walls, creating an enclosed spot in between. Thankfully this doesn't happen very often (yet). There are two ways to avoid this: a) Relax
--    the VETO restriction, this shouldn't actually be a problem because Crawl automatically generates trapdoors anyway! Crawl could instead / additionally fill the area with
--    no_tele_into (but on its own this doesn't solve the problem that an off-level hatch/shaft could land the player there, and possibly end them up in an a multi-level
--    hatch loop!)  b) Actually detect and handle such enclosed areas during layout generation. This sounds hard to do in a performance-friendly way but it only needs
--    a check when we're attaching to an open_eligible, need to check each tile that's still open for connectivity to the room we just placed (or some sort of flood fill).
-- 4. General performance - it's definitely ok in V but some of the experimental layouts I've tried have more problems. A big factor is needing to eliminate more eligible
--    spots when we place rooms because once a level is really busy most placement attempts are doomed. When we place a room we should send out rays in the directions
--    of normals and if we hit something close (or map edge) then that wall is no longer eligible. The trigger proximity needs to be 1 less than the smallest room that can fit.
--    This should vastly help.
-- 5. Additional corridor / door carving. Send rays out from walls (in combination with the above) and if a room is within a suitable proximity (e.g. < 5) then we can
--    carve out a corridor and doors.
-- 6. Room flipping. Should be fairly straightforward now; we need to a) invert the x or y normal dependending on which way we're flipping, b) appropriately adjust the logic
--    of vault placement and c) similarly flip the final usage normals. I'm just hesitant to throw this spanner in the works before everything else is 100% working.
