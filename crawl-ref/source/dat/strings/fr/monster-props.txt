# Monster properties
#
# Used in a couple of places:
#  1. When targeting
#  2. When examining with xv in brackets after the monster name
#  3. On mouse hover, in the sentence: "This monster is %s."
#  4. In a message when monster comes into view
#
# For #3, a custom sentence is used for some props, instead of sticking the
# property string into the generic sentence above.
#
# Additionally, some properties have a different short form (some even have
# singular and plural short forms), but all the above places use the long form,
# so not sure where the short forms are used.
