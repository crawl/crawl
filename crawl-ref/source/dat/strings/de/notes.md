## Specific Terms

Choosing translations is not always easy for several reasons:

- Word meanings in the context of DCSS may not match common usage
- Many words have overlapping meaning in general usage, but specific distinct meanings in DCSS (e.g. pain, agony and torment are all distinct things in DCSS)
- Sometimes there is no direct translation for an English word
- Sometimes multiple words with distinct meaning in English translate to a single word in the other language (and vice versa)

I have chosen the following translations (explanations below):

- intelligence = Intelligenz
- dexterity = Geschicklichkeit
- strength = Stärke
- might = Macht
- power = Kraft
- distortion = Verzerrung
- pain = Schmerzen
- agony = Agonie
- torment = Qual
- magic wand = Zauberstab
- magic staff = magischer Stecken
- evoke = evozieren
- invoke (call on a god) = anrufen
- summon/summoning = herbeirufen/Herbeirufung
- conjure/conjuration = hervorrufen/Hervorrufung
- transmutation = Verwandlung
- mage = Magier
- wizard = Zauberer
- barding = Gelieger
- blink (short-range teleport) = blinzeln
- resistance = Resistenz
- put on (jewellery) - anlegen
- wear (armour) - anlegen
- remove (jewellery) = ablegen
- take off (armour) = ablegen
- drop - hinlegen/absetzen (TODO: standardise)
- ability = Fähigkeit
- skill = Fertigkeit
- dodging (skill) = Ausweichen
- evasion (attribute) = Umgehung
- Lair (dungeon branch) = Versteck
- stash (pile of items) = Versteck (one of these will need to be changed)
- The Shining One (god) = der Glänzende (would der Leuchtende be better?)
- sling bullet = Schleuderkugel (would Schleudergeschoss be better?)
- shock = Schock

Words that have a very specific meaning in the context of DCSS that may not match common usage, or at least not include all possible meanings in common usage:

- invoke - use a god-given ability (i.e. call forth divine power or call on a god to do something)
- evoke - use an ability granted by an item (i.e call forth the power of an item)
- summon - call forth a demon/being/animal
- conjure - call forth something inanimate like fire, energy, etc. (NOT demons, etc. In common usage, one can conjure a demon/spirit, but not in DCSS.)
- torment vs. agony - these are two different spells. Agony does moderate amount of damage. Torment halves current HP.
- blink - short-range teleport
- strength vs. might vs. power - strength is a player attribute like dexterity and intelligence. It affects damage dealt, but also lowers the effect of armour encumbrance. Might is a temporary status effect that increases damage dealt. Power normally means the strength of a magic spell.
- berserk vs. frenzy vs. rage vs. rampage - Berserk is a status affect/ability that makes a player/monster faster and stronger, but because they're in wild, unthinking state, they cannot do things like read or cast spells. Frenzy is similar to berserk, but only for monsters. It also makes them unable to distinguish friend from foe. Rage is a property of items that causes a player to go berserk. Rampage is a property of items that makes the player rush towards enemies. It does not put them in a berserk/frenzied state.
- wizard - a generalist mage
- conjurer - In common usage, a synonym for wizard, but in DCSS, specifically a mage specialising in conjuration (see above)
- enchanter - In common usage, a synonym for wizard, but in DCSS, specifically a mage specialising in hexes, which debuff enemies (slow, etc.). There is also an enemy called the Enchantress (feminine form of enchanter), who casts those kinds of spells.
- shapeshifter/shifter - a shapeshifter changes their shape. A (draconian) shifter moves players/monsters around with magic.
- shock - the spell gives and electric shock. This would normally be called Stromschlag in German, but the DnD SRD 5.1 on p353 uses Schock for the similarly named Will-o-Wisp (Irrlicht) ability. Also, Google Ngrams finds many hits for "elecktrischer Schock, although Stromschlag and elektrisher Schlag are far more common.

- In everyday English, drain and sap are synonyms, but not in DCSS. Sap is a specific effect that makes magic difficult to use (but it's different from merely draining mana). Also drain is used in a couple of different ways. There is "drain life", which drains the player's max HP, and has the associated brand "drain", and the status "drained". However, it's also possible to drain stats (strength, etc.), and MP (mana).
- The situation in German is similar. There are many words that have similar meanings: entziehen, auslaugen, zehren, aufzehren, auszehren, abzehren, verzehren.
https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=266173/auslaugen
- Some relevant links:
- https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6770/sap
- https://www.wowhead.com/spell=151329/sap-magic
https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=151329/magie-entziehen
https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=225420/die-lebenden-auszehren
https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=187340/aufzehren
https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=266173/auslaugen
https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=134776/entziehen
https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=339460/entzug
- I went with drain = entziehen for the actual act of draining strength or whatever, drained (of max HP) = (aus)gezehrt, sap = auslaugen

The German word Stab means both staff and wand. One can distinguish Zauberstab (magic wand/staff) from Kampfstab (fighting staff), but how do you distinguish a magical staff from a magic wand? Seems like Harry Potter's wand is a Zauberstab, but so is Gandalf's staff. [5] uses Stecken for magical staves.

- [5] has might = Stärke, but that means strength, so I went for Macht.
- heroism = Heldenmut [5]
- transmutation = Verwandlung [5]
- experience points = Erfahrungspunkte [5]
- rage = Kampfrausch (lit. battle frenzy) [5]
- abjuration = Bannmagie [5]
- banishment = Verbannung [5]
- melee = Nahkampf [12]

Conjuration/Summoning/Evocation are problematic. They can be used interchangably in English, and there are also overalapping meanings of the corresponding words in German. [5] has:

- Evocation -> Hervorrufung (Seems to correspond to DCSS Conjuration)
- Conjuration -> Beschwörung (Seems to be a combination DCSS Conjuration and Summoning)

Comparing http://www.baldurs-gate.ch/bg2/ to https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Spells_%28Baldur%27s_Gate_II%29#Schools_of_magic:

- Conjuration/Summoning -> Herbeirufung/Beschwörung
- Evocation/Invocation -> Anrufung/Hervorrufung

Looking in the dictionary:

- Herbeirufen clearly means summon: https://de.thefreedictionary.com/herbeirufen
- Beschwören seems to also mean summon: https://de.thefreedictionary.com/beschw%c3%b6ren
- Anrufen means to call someone, including a god, for help (i.e. invoke): https://de.thefreedictionary.com/anrufen
- Hervorrufen seems to mean evoke: https://de.thefreedictionary.com/hervorrufen
- Hervorzaubern seems to unambiguously mean conjure: https://de.pons.com/%C3%BCbersetzung/deutsch-englisch/hervorzaubern
- Hervorrufer=conjurer: https://www.wowhead.com/de/npc=162288/hervorrufer-des-schwarzen-imperiums

It's difficult to choose translations for the different types of magic users. I've gone with:

- Wizard -> Zauberer (because that's what they used for Harry Potter)
- the Enchantress -> die Zauberin, retaining the double-meaning
- Sorcerer -> Hexenmeister
- Mage -> Magier (so Earth Mage -> Erdmagier, etc.)
- Shifter -> Verschieber (because verschieben means to move, displace)

The German for "(hob)goblin" is "Kobold", but there are already kobolds in the game, so I've kept the English names.

Zyme is an obscure word for something that causes infection. It's related to the word enzyme.
Since the German word for enzyme is das Enzym, it's logical that Zyme -> das Zym.

Ballistomycete is a made up word, but the mycete ending, meaning fungus, is used in real words like myxomycete, actinomycete, etc.
Duden has Myxomyzet as a weak masculine noun: https://www.duden.de/deklination/substantive/Myxomyzet
Google Ngrams indicates that Myxomycete exists in German, but Myxomyzet is more common:
https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Myxomyzet%2CMyxomycete&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=31&smoothing=3
Actinomycete/Aktinomyzet is similar:
https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Actinomycete%2CAktinomyzet&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=31&smoothing=3

Not sure how to translate Ballostomycete spore. Words like Myxospore exist in both German and English, but the English version
of Crawl does not use Ballistospore. How do you form a compound noun with Ballistomyzet? Ballistomyzetenspore?

Boggart - in Harry Potter this is translated as der Irrwicht (pl: die Irrwichte), but the Spook-Zyklus (Wardstone Chronicles),
Boggart (pl: Boggarts) is used: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook-Zyklus

Eleionoma - German plural is Eleionomai - ref: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleionomai

Efreet is der Ifrit in German: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit (but Efreet is an archaic form)

Spriggan is translated as der Zweigling here: https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/de/wiki/Zweigling

Deathcap is Knollenblätterpilz in German: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCner_Knollenbl%C3%A4tterpilz

Ghost/wraith/spectre/phantom are all synonyms in everyday English, but distinct in DCSS.
Some equivalent German words are Geist, Gespenst, Spuk, Phantom, Schemen, Schreckgespenst, Spukgespenst, Spukgestalt.
[5] translates wraith as Todesalb, but it seems to be a pretty uncommon word.

Blink - in [5] translated as Flimmern.
      - in [6] translated as Blinzeln: https://de.classic.wowhead.com/search?q=blinzeln

Some specific terms from the German D&D System Reference Document [17]:

- spell = Zauber
- cantrip (simple spell) = Zaubertick
- spell level = Zaubergrad
- spell slot = Zauberplatz (in D&D, these are used up when you cast spells, and are replenished by resting)
- cast spell = einen Zauber wirken
- (spell) range = Reichweite
- casting time = Zeitaufwand
- (spell) duration = Wirkungsdauer
- area of effect = Wirkungsbereich
- abjuration = Bannzauber
- skill = fertigkeit
- experience points = Erfahrungspunkte
- hit dice = Trefferwürfel
- manual = Handbuch
- potion = Trank
- breath weapon = Odemwaffe
- disruption (affects undead) - Zusammenbruch

In DCSS, barding is used to mean the piece of armour that covers the midsection of Nagas and Palentongas (and previously, the horsey part of a centaur).
This is taken from the word for horse armour, but it's kind of a misnomer because barding refers to the entire suit of horse armour, not just the middle part.

In German, armour for a horse is called der Rossharnisch or das Gelieger. Again, this refers to the entire thing, not just the middle part.
We can't really use the word Rossharnisch because Ross is a warhorse. Nor can we use Harnisch by itself, because that just means armour.
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europ%C3%A4ischer_Rossharnisch

## Adjectives

DCSS dynamically adds adjectives to things (unidentified items in particular).
This is easy in English because there's no declension of adjectives.
German adjectives, on the other hand, take various endings, and the rules are rather complex...

### Prepositional adjective
no ending

### Weak declension
after definite article (the)

CASE          |MASC |FEM  |NEUT |PLURAL
--------------|-----|-----|-----|------
Nominative    |-e   |-e   |-e   |-en
Accusative    |-en  |-e   |-e   |-en
Dative        |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en
Genitive      |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en

### Mixed declension
after indefinite article (a/an) or possessives (your, etc.)

CASE          |MASC |FEM  |NEUT |PLURAL
--------------|-----|-----|-----|------
Nominative    |-er  |-e   |-es  |-en
Accusative    |-en  |-e   |-es  |-en
Dative        |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en
Genitive      |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en

### Strong declension
when no determiner or after number

CASE          |MASC |FEM  |NEUT |PLURAL
--------------|-----|-----|-----|------
Nominative    |-er  |-e   |-es  |-e
Accusative    |-en  |-e   |-es  |-e
Dative        |-em  |-er  |-em  |-en
Genitive      |-en  |-er  |-en  |-er

Or to put it another way:
-e used for: feminine nom/acc; neuter definite nom/acc; plural nom/acc without determiner
-es used for: neuter nom/acc, except definite
-er used for: masculine nom, except definite; feminine and plural gen without determiner
-en otherwise

Example:

### Weak declension
CASE          |MASC               |FEM               |NEUT                    |PLURAL
--------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------
Nominative    |der feine Ring     |die feine Axt     |das feine Schwert       |die feinen Pfeile
Accusative    |den feinen Ring    |die feine Axt     |das feine Schwert       |die feinen Pfeile
Dative        |dem feinen Ring    |der feinen Axt    |dem feinen Schwert      |den feinen Pfeilen
Genitive      |des feinen Rings   |der feinen Axt    |des feinen Schwerts     |der feinen Pfeile

### Mixed declension
CASE          |MASC                |FEM               |NEUT                   |PLURAL
--------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------
Nominative    |ein feiner Ring     |eine feine Axt    |ein feines Schwert     |deine feinen Pfeile
Accusative    |einen feinen Ring   |eine feine Axt    |ein feines Schwert     |deine feinen Pfeile
Dative        |einem feinen Ring   |einer feinen Axt  |einem feinen Schwert   |deinen feinen Pfeilen
Genitive      |eines feinen Rings  |einer feinen Axt  |eines feinen Schwerts  |deinen feinen Pfeile

### Strong declension
CASE          |MASC                |FEM               |NEUT                   |PLURAL
--------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------
Nominative    |feiner Ring         |feine Axt         |feines Schwert         |2 feine Pfeile
Accusative    |feinen Ring         |feine Axt         |feines Schwert         |2 feine Pfeile
Dative        |feinem Ring         |feiner Axt        |feinem Schwert         |2 feinen Pfeilen
Genitive      |feinen Rings        |feiner Axt        |feinen Schwerts        |2 feiner Pfeile

In practice, in DCSS, we see:
- plurals: with number, so strong declension and probably only ever nom/acc (i.e. probably always -e ending)
- singular: with the/a/an/your/etc., so weak or mixed declension, unlikely to see genitive
So in practice, the -e ending will be most common, but -en, -er and -es are also possible.
We're unlikely to ever use the -em ending.
For this reason, I've made the form with the -e ending the default (i.e. no msgctxt).

To do list:
- generate toggle list like "Cast|<w>Describe</w>|Hide|Show", so we don't have to give translations for every possible state
- remove add_attack_strength_punct/attack_strength_message - this can be handled within localise()
- revisit attack_stop_prompt - currently we are ignoring the verb parameter
