## Specific Terms

DCSS has many terms that have a specific meaning within the game and so need to be translated consistently
everywhere they occur. However, choosing translations is not always easy for several reasons:

- Word meanings in the context of DCSS may not match common usage
- Many words have overlapping meaning in general usage, but specific distinct meanings in DCSS (e.g. pain, agony and torment are all distinct things in DCSS)
- Sometimes there is no direct translation for an English word
- Sometimes multiple words with distinct meaning in English translate to a single word in the other language (and vice versa)


These have overlapping meanings in general usage, but distinct meanings in DCSS:

- ability = some special action you can do (can be inborn in your species, or be granted by your god or by an item)
- skill = a competence that is improved through training
- aptitude = an inborn quality of your species that determines how easy it is to train a specific skill

We used:

- ability = Fähigkeit
- skill = Fertigkeit
- aptitude = Begabung

Another set:

- pain = a spell/ability that causes a small amount of damage
- agony = a spell/ability that causes a large amount of damage
- torment = a spell/ability that halves the target's HP. There is also a monster with this ability called a tormentor.

We used:

- pain = Schmerz
- agony = Agonie
- torment = Peinigung (and Peiniger for tomentor)

Another set:

- drain (life) - Whan applied to the player, this reduces max HP. There is a related weapon brand called "draining" and the status "drained"
- (stat) drain - reduce stats (STR/DEX/INT)
- drain is also used in a more general sense. For example, ghost moths drain MP (mana)
- sap (magic) - An effect caused by Demonspawn Warmongers that causes you to be unable to cast spells.
- exhaust(ion) - If an ability causes exhaustion, it means you can't use that ability (or any other ability that causes Exhaustion) again until Exhaustion wears off. It has no other effect.

In German, there are many words that have similar meanings: entziehen, auslaugen, zehren, aufzehren, auszehren, abzehren, verzehren.
Some relevant links:

- https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6770/sap
- https://www.wowhead.com/spell=151329/sap-magic

- https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=134776/entziehen
- https://www.wowhead.com/de/spell=339460/entzug

We used:

- drain/draining/drained = auszehren/Auszehrung/ausgezehrt
- sap/sapped = auslaugen/ausgelaugt
- exhaustion/exhausted = Erschöpfung/erschöpft

Another set of synonyms that have distinct meanings in DCSS:

- berserk - a status affect/ability that makes a player/monster faster and stronger, but because they're in wild, unthinking state, they cannot do things like read or cast
- frenzy - similar to berserk, but it makes the affected being unable to distinguish friend from foe.
- rage - a property of items that causes a player to go berserk.
- rampage - a property of items that makes the player rush towards enemies. It does not put them in a berserk/frenzied state.

We used:

- berserk = Berserkerwut
- berserker (background) = Berserker
- frenzy = Raserei
- rage = Kampfrausch (lit. battle frenzy) [5]
- rampage = randalieren/Randalierung

Another set:

- strength - one of the player's 3 main attributes/stats, along with dexterity and intelligence
- might - a temporary status effect that increases damage dealt
- power - spell power, but also in the names of some divine abilities

We used:

- strength = Stärke
- might = Macht
- power = Kraft

Different types of magic users:

- mage = Magier
- wizard (a generalist mage) = Zauberer
- sorcerer (a powerful mage - orc sorcerers are more dangerous than orc wizards) -> Hexenmeister
- conjurer (a mage that specialises in conjurations) - Konjurant (see also conjurations below)
- enchanter (a mage that specialises in hexes) - Verzauberer
- the Enchantress -> die Zauberin, retaining the double-meaning
- witch = Hexe

Also, note:

- (draconian) shifter - (this is NOT a shapeshifter/transmuter (Verwandler) - shift here refers to movement via blinking/teleportation) = Verschieber

Banishment has a very specific meaning in DCSS:

- banishment (send the player or a monster to the Abyss) = Verbannung [5]
- abjuration (get rid of a summoned monster) = Annulierung (there is probably a better translation than this)

The German word Zauber can mean both magic and spell.

- spell = Zauber or Zauberspruch
- magic = Magie or Zauberei

Stab is the usual German word for both wand and staff. We used:

- magic wand = Zauberstab
- magic staff = magischer Stab

Lair can be translated as Versteck (which also means stash) or Höhle (which also means cave). We used:

- Lair (of beasts) = Höhle (der Bestien)
- stash (pile of items) = Versteck
- ice cave = Eishöhle

Dodging and evasion:

- dodging (skill) = Ausweichen
- evasion (derived attribute) = Ausweichen

DCSS has specific terms for equipping/unequipping jewellery vs armour vs weapons.

Jewellery (rings and amulets):

- put on = anlegen
- remove = abnehmen

Armour (including body armour, hat, helmet, gloves, boots, barding, cloak):

- wear = anziehen (the usual German word is tragen, but that also means carry)
- take off = ausziehen

These words work for body armour, but do they work for other things like hats, boots, etc.?

Weapons:

- wield = handhaben (schwingen and führen also considered)
- unwield = wegstecken (lit. put away - I couldn't think of a better translation)

The word "level" is used in many different things in DCSS:

- Dungeon level (floor) = Ebene
- Experience level = (Erfahrungs)stufe
- Skill level = Stufe
- Spell level (e.g. level 9 spell) = Stufe (Grad, Rang?)
- Spell level (how much "room" you have to memorise spells) = Zauberplatz

The last one is weird usage by DCSS. Most games would use "spell slots".
DCSS uses spell slot to mean the letter assigned to the spell in the spell casting menu
(analogous to item slots in the inventory screen).

- armour = Rüstung (or Panzerung)
- mail = Panzer

It seems to be common practice to translate leather armour as Lederrüstung, and chainmail as Kettenpanzer, and so on.
Plate armour (often called plate mail in other games) is Plattenpanzer.

- barding = der Harnisch

In real life, horse armour, but in DCSS, armour for the back/lower part of a centaur/naga/palentonga.
In German, armour for a horse is called der Rossharnisch. However, ein Ross is a warhorse, so it
doesn't really work for naga or palentonga. Harnisch by itself just means armour, but since we haven't
used that word for anything else, it's ok.
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europ%C3%A4ischer_Rossharnisch

Some other terms:

- intelligence = Intelligenz
- dexterity = Geschicklichkeit
- distortion = Verzerrung
- transmutation = Verwandlung
- resistance = Resistenz
- drop - hinlegen/absetzen (TODO: standardise)
- The Shining One (god) = der Strahlende (Glänzende and Leuchtende were also considered)
- sling bullet = Schleuderkugel (would Schleudergeschoss be better?)
- heroism = Heldenmut [5]
- transmutation = Verwandlung [5]
- experience points = Erfahrungspunkte [5]
- melee = Nahkampf [12]
- ranged combat = Fernkampf
- potion = Trank
- gold coins/gold pieces = Goldmünzen
- teleport = teleportieren
- blink (short-range teleport) = blinzeln

In [5], blink is translated as Flimmern.
In [6] translated as Blinzeln: https://de.classic.wowhead.com/search?q=blinzeln

- shock = Schock

The spell gives and electric shock. This would normally be called Stromschlag in German, but the DnD SRD 5.1 on p353 uses Schock for the similarly named Will-o-Wisp (Irrlicht) ability. Also, Google Ngrams finds many hits for "elecktrischer Schock, although Stromschlag and elektrisher Schlag are far more common.

Some specific terms from the German D&D System Reference Document [17]:

- cantrip (simple spell) = Zaubertrick
- spell level = Zaubergrad
- spell slot = Zauberplatz (in D&D, these are used up when you cast spells, and are replenished by resting)
- cast spell = einen Zauber wirken
- (spell) range = Reichweite
- casting time = Zeitaufwand
- (spell) duration = Wirkungsdauer
- area of effect = Wirkungsbereich
- abjuration = Bannzauber
- experience points = Erfahrungspunkte
- hit dice = Trefferwürfel
- manual = Handbuch
- breath weapon = Odemwaffe
- disruption (affects undead) - Zusammenbruch


## Conjuration vs Summoning vs Evocation vs Invocation

This was one of the trickiest translations. These have overlapping meanings in general usage, but distinct meanings in DCSS:

- summon = call forth a being (animal, demon, etc.)
- conjure = call forth something inanimate (e.g. fire, ice, etc.)
- evoke = use the ability of an item
- invoke = use a divine ability (i.e. call on a god to do something)

We used:

- summon/summoning/summoner = beschwören/Beschwörung/Beschwörer
- conjure/conjuration/conjurare = ?/Konjuration/Konjurant
- evoke/evocation = evozieren/Evozierung
- invoke/invocation = anrufen/Anrufung

D&D ([5]) has:

- Evocation = Hervorrufung (but this seems to correspond to DCSS Conjuration)
- Conjuration = Beschwörung (seems to be a combination DCSS Conjuration and Summoning)

Baldurs gate:

Comparing https://www.baldurs-gate.ch/bg2/char/magie/magierschulen.html
and https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Spells_%28Baldur%27s_Gate_II%29#Schools_of_magic yields some translations.

However, the terms in BG don't always match the meanings in DCSS.

Conjuration: "Herbeirufung holt normalerweise Dinge oder Gegenstände von einem anderen Ort." (In DCSS, Conjuration creates things rather then bringing them from somewhere else.)

Summoning: "Eine Beschwörung ermöglicht es dem Zaubernden, lebende Wesen und Kräfte zu beschwören oder Energien von anderen Ebenen zu kanalisieren." (The Wesen part at least matches DCSS.)

"Eine Anrufung (Evocation) ruft normalerweise ein höheres Wesen an, das die Energie dann nach Wünschen des Zaubernden einsetzen soll, und bei einer Hervorrufung (Invocation) wird die Energie direkt vom Zaubernden geformt."

(So, Baldur's Gate's Evocation/Anrufung is Invocation in DCSS, and BG's Invocation/Hervorrufung is more like DCSS's Conjuration.)

This gives us:

- BG Conjuration (no equivalent in DCSS) -> Herbeirufung
- BG Summoning (~DCSS Summoning) -> Beschwörung
- BG Evocation (DCSS Invocation) -> Anrufung
- BG Invocation (DCSS Conjuration) -> Hervorrufung

Looking in the dictionary:

- Herbeirufen clearly means summon: https://de.thefreedictionary.com/herbeirufen
- Beschwören seems to also mean summon: https://www.dwds.de/wb/beschw%C3%B6ren?o=bewschw%C3%B6ren
- Anrufen means to call someone, including a god, for help: https://de.thefreedictionary.com/anrufen
- Hervorrufen seems to mean evoke: https://de.thefreedictionary.com/hervorrufen
- Hervorzaubern seems to unambiguously mean conjure: https://de.pons.com/%C3%BCbersetzung/deutsch-englisch/hervorzaubern
- Hervorrufer=conjurer: https://www.wowhead.com/de/npc=162288/hervorrufer-des-schwarzen-imperiums


## Monsters

Elf = der Elf (seems to be used in high fantasy in preference to die Elfe)

Kobold is the German word for goblin, but kobolds and goblins are distinct monsters in DCSS. I've kept them the same in German.
Since the English version uses a German word, I figure the German version can use an English word.

Ball Python is a real animal. It's called Königspython in German.

Ghost/wraith/phantom/spectre are all synonyms in everyday English, but distinct in DCSS.
Some equivalent German words are Geist, Gespenst, Spuk, Phantom, Schemen, Schreckgespenst, Spukgespenst, Spukgestalt, Spektrum (archaic).
[5] translates wraith as Todesalb, but it seems to be a pretty uncommon word.
This needs to be fixed up.

Zyme is an obscure word for something that causes infection. It's related to the word enzyme.
Since the German word for enzyme is das Enzym, it's logical that Zyme -> das Zym.

Ballistomycete is a made up word, but the mycete ending, meaning fungus, is used in real words like myxomycete, actinomycete, etc.
Duden has Myxomyzet as a weak masculine noun: https://www.duden.de/deklination/substantive/Myxomyzet
Google Ngrams indicates that Myxomycete exists in German, but Myxomyzet is more common:
https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Myxomyzet%2CMyxomycete&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=31&smoothing=3
Actinomycete/Aktinomyzet is similar:
https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Actinomycete%2CAktinomyzet&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=31&smoothing=3

Not sure how to translate Ballostomycete spore. Words like Myxospore exist in both German and English, but the English version
of Crawl does not use Ballistospore. How do you form a compound noun with Ballistomyzet? Ballistomyzetenspore?

Boggart - in Harry Potter this is translated as der Irrwicht (pl: die Irrwichte), but the Spook-Zyklus (Wardstone Chronicles),
Boggart (pl: Boggarts) is used: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook-Zyklus

Eleionoma - German plural is Eleionomai - ref: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleionomai

Efreet is der Ifrit in German: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit (but Efreet is an archaic form)

Spriggan is translated as der Zweigling here: https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/de/wiki/Zweigling. I guess they did this because a sprig is a small branch.
I'm not sure that the "sprig" in spriggan really has anything to do with branches, but I guess we can go with that translation.  
http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spriggan  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spriggan  

Deathcap is Knollenblätterpilz in German: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCner_Knollenbl%C3%A4tterpilz


## Adjectives

DCSS dynamically adds adjectives to things (unidentified items in particular).
This is easy in English because there's no declension of adjectives.
German adjectives, on the other hand, take various endings, and the rules are rather complex...

### Prepositional adjective
no ending

### Weak declension
after definite article (the)

CASE          |MASC |FEM  |NEUT |PLURAL
--------------|-----|-----|-----|------
Nominative    |-e   |-e   |-e   |-en
Accusative    |-en  |-e   |-e   |-en
Dative        |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en
Genitive      |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en

### Mixed declension
after indefinite article (a/an) or possessives (your, etc.)

CASE          |MASC |FEM  |NEUT |PLURAL
--------------|-----|-----|-----|------
Nominative    |-er  |-e   |-es  |-en
Accusative    |-en  |-e   |-es  |-en
Dative        |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en
Genitive      |-en  |-en  |-en  |-en

### Strong declension
when no determiner or after number

CASE          |MASC |FEM  |NEUT |PLURAL
--------------|-----|-----|-----|------
Nominative    |-er  |-e   |-es  |-e
Accusative    |-en  |-e   |-es  |-e
Dative        |-em  |-er  |-em  |-en
Genitive      |-en  |-er  |-en  |-er

Or to put it another way:
-e used for: feminine nom/acc; neuter definite nom/acc; plural nom/acc without determiner
-es used for: neuter nom/acc, except definite
-er used for: masculine nom, except definite; feminine and plural gen without determiner
-en otherwise

Example:

### Weak declension
CASE          |MASC               |FEM               |NEUT                    |PLURAL
--------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------
Nominative    |der feine Ring     |die feine Axt     |das feine Schwert       |die feinen Pfeile
Accusative    |den feinen Ring    |die feine Axt     |das feine Schwert       |die feinen Pfeile
Dative        |dem feinen Ring    |der feinen Axt    |dem feinen Schwert      |den feinen Pfeilen
Genitive      |des feinen Rings   |der feinen Axt    |des feinen Schwerts     |der feinen Pfeile

### Mixed declension
CASE          |MASC                |FEM               |NEUT                   |PLURAL
--------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------
Nominative    |ein feiner Ring     |eine feine Axt    |ein feines Schwert     |deine feinen Pfeile
Accusative    |einen feinen Ring   |eine feine Axt    |ein feines Schwert     |deine feinen Pfeile
Dative        |einem feinen Ring   |einer feinen Axt  |einem feinen Schwert   |deinen feinen Pfeilen
Genitive      |eines feinen Rings  |einer feinen Axt  |eines feinen Schwerts  |deinen feinen Pfeile

### Strong declension
CASE          |MASC                |FEM               |NEUT                   |PLURAL
--------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------
Nominative    |feiner Ring         |feine Axt         |feines Schwert         |2 feine Pfeile
Accusative    |feinen Ring         |feine Axt         |feines Schwert         |2 feine Pfeile
Dative        |feinem Ring         |feiner Axt        |feinem Schwert         |2 feinen Pfeilen
Genitive      |feinen Rings        |feiner Axt        |feinen Schwerts        |2 feiner Pfeile

In practice, in DCSS, we see:
- plurals: with number, so strong declension and probably only ever nom/acc (i.e. probably always -e ending)
- singular: with the/a/an/your/etc., so weak or mixed declension, unlikely to see genitive
So in practice, the -e ending will be most common, but -en, -er and -es are also possible.
We're unlikely to ever use the -em ending.
For this reason, I've made the form with the -e ending the default (i.e. no msgctxt).

To do list:
- generate toggle list like "Cast|<w>Describe</w>|Hide|Show", so we don't have to give translations for every possible state
- remove add_attack_strength_punct/attack_strength_message - this can be handled within localise()
- revisit attack_stop_prompt - currently we are ignoring the verb parameter
