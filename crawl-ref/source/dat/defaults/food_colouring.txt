### Colouring of corpses, depending on whether you can eat them, and
### whether it's safe to eat them.
### Use menu_colour (inv) to colour items in your inventory or the
### pickup menu.

inv := menu_colour

# Djinn can eat, but most foodstuff is useless.
inv += $inedible:.*useless_item.*carrion.*

# Other forbidden foods are handled in menu_colors.txt, where they
# will be overridden by "useless" and "inedible".
inv += $forbidden:.*forbidden.*corpse

# Quoth gammafunk.rc: menu_colour only cares for the first match.
# Therefore, this line must come _before_ the line handling mutagenic food,
# if mutagenic chunks are to show up red for Zin worshippers.
inv += $forbidden:.*forbidden.*

inv += $preferred:.*preferred.*
