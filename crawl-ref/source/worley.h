This function is hardwired to return an average F_1 value    of 1.0. It returns the <n> most closest feature point distances    F_1, F_2, .. F_n the vector delta to those points, and a 32 bit    seed for each of the feature points. This function is not    difficult to extend to compute alternative information such as    higher order F values, to use the Manhattan distance metric, or    other fun perversions.     <at>    The input sample location.    <max_order>  Smaller values compute faster. < 5, read the book to extend it.    <F>     The output values of F_1, F_2, ..F[n] in F[0], F[1], F[n-1]    <delta> The output vector difference between the sample point and the n-th             closest feature point. Thus, the feature point's location is the             hit point minus this value. The DERIVATIVE of F is the unit             normalized version of this vector.    <ID>    The output 32 bit ID number which labels the feature point. This             is useful for domain partitions, especially for coloring flagstone             patterns.     This implementation is tuned for speed in a way that any order > 5    will likely have discontinuous artefacts in its computation of F5+.    This can be fixed by increasing the internal points-per-cube    density in the source code, at the expense of slower    computation. The book lists the details of this tuning.  */ #pragma once namespace worley { struct noise_datum {     double distance[2];     uint32_t id[2];     double pos[2][3]; };  noise_datum noise(double x, double y, double z); }
