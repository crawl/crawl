/* I'm sure there's a name for this, but remember that if you want to
 * refactor some monster method, you can create a copy of it so that you
 * can test your new, refactored version has the same behaviour as the
 * old, spaghetti version.
 *
 * Here is an example. I copied player::base_ac to player::new_base_ac.
 * Then I was able to refactor player::new_base_ac, confident I was
 * preserving behaviour. My final change was to rename new_base_ac to
 * base_ac, delete the old base_ac function, and delete the new_base_ac
 * function header.
