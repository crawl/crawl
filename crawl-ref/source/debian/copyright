Comment:
 The majority of Crawl's tiles and artwork are released under the CC0 license

 under this license unless otherwise specified. However, the licensing situation
 may be complex, especially for older pieces. For information regarding the
 licenses of our tiles and artwork, see https://github.com/crawl/tiles
