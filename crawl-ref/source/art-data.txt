# This file contains the definitions of undrandarts (and what used to be
# fixed artefacts).  util/art-data.pl translates this file into
# art-data.h, and also updates the enumeration and NO_UNRANDARTS in
# artefact.h.  C/C++ functions which give unrandarts non-standard
# behaviour are in art-func.h; util/art-data.pl scans art-func.h and
# puts the function names found into art-data.h.
#
# Each artefact definition is separated by one or more blank lines.
#
# Each artefact definition must have the NAME, APPEAR, OBJ and COLOUR
# fields.
#
# The name and appearance of each unrandart must be unique.
#
# Changing the name of an unrand will change its automatically
# generated enumeration, unless its enumeration is forced with ENUM.
#
# "ENUM: FOO" can be used to force the enumeration for an unrand to be
# "UNRAND_FOO", for cases where the automatically generated enumerations
# of different unrandarts conflict.
#
# Add new artefact definitions at the end of the file; doing so should cause
# no problems with save-file compatibilty, but for tile builds it will
# cause a shift of remembered tiles (since each new unrandart needs its
# own tiles).  Changing the order of the definitions will likely cause
# strange behaviour in games saved previous to the change, and deleting
# definitions will break savefile compatibility.
#
# ####### TILES #############################
#
# Each unrandart needs at the very least an item tile, and weapons and armour
# also need an equipment tile for the player doll. For the former, you can
# define the image file within this file using the keyword TILE. The files are
# assumed to be png and the syntax does not include the file type. The
# artefacts' base type decides where a tile needs to be placed. These are as
# follows:
#     Weapons: rltiles/item/weapon/artefact
#     Armour:  rltiles/item/armour/artefact
#     Rings:   rltiles/item/ring/artefact
#     Amulets: rltiles/item/amulet/artefact
#
# If the tile requires a black outline (because it would be hard to see
# otherwise) add "tilerim" to the artefact's boolean properties. Otherwise
# the image is used without modification.
#
# Run util/art-data.pl to update the autogenerated dc-unrand.txt and thus
# actually include the tile in main.png.
#
# For the equipment tile, place the tile into the appropriate subdirectory of
# rltiles/player/ and define it in rltiles/dc-player.txt as well as here, using
# the keyword TILE_EQ. Tiles are sorted into directories by equipment slot:
#     Weapons:     rltiles/player/hand1/artefact
#     Body armour: rltiles/player/body
#     Boots:       rltiles/player/boots
#     Cloaks:      rltiles/player/cloak
#     Gloves:      rltiles/player/gloves
#     Shields:     rltiles/player/hand2
#     Helms, caps: rltiles/player/head
#
# Rings and amulets are too small to be displayed with the player doll.
#
# To begin with, placeholders (e.g. the base type tiles) are fine, but they'll
# eventually need to be replaced with proper tiles, though this is less of a
# problem for the equipment tiles.
# No checks are made for whether path or files actually exist. However, if that
# is not the case the tile compilation will fail.

#############################################################################

# Explanation of unusual fields:

# BOOL: Turn certain boolean properties of the artefact on, with the list
# of properties separated by commas.  The list includes:
#
# * berserk:  Lets wearer evoke berserking ability.
# * blink:    Lets wearer evoke the blink ability.
# * chaotic:  Is treated as a chaotic item.
# * cursed:   Item is generated cursed.
# * elec:     Grants electrical resistance.
# * evil:     Is treated as an evil item.
# * holy:     Is treated as a holy item.
# * inv:      Lets wearer evoke invisibility ability.
# * lev:      Lets wearer evoke levitation ability.
# * life:     Grants negative energy resistance.
# * noises:   Weapon makes noises.  Can be given its own set of noises by
#             making an entry in dat/database/wpnnoise.txt, with the
#             entry's key exactly the same as the weapon's name, but all
#             lowercase.
# * nospell:  Prevents wearer from casting spells.
# * notelep:  Prevents wearer from teleporting or blinking.
# * poison:   Grants poison resistance.
# * rnd_tele: Induces random teleportation.
# * seeinv:   Lets wearer see invisible.
# * special:  Artefact is "special": can't be picked up by monsters,
#             can't be affected by Tukima's Dance, generated less
#             frequently than normal randarts, can be generated in the
#             Abyss if its been lost elsewhere.
# * tilerim:  Adds a black outline to the tile, see above section.

# ENUM: Forces the artefact's enumeration literal to something specific.
# For example, "ENUM: FOO" gives the enumeration "UNRAND_FOO".  The
# default enumeration is determined as follows:
#
# 1) If there's a string between double quotes, use that.
# 2) If #1 doesn't apply and the name contains " of " or " of the ",
#    use what's after that.
# 3) If neither #1 no #2 apply, use the full name.
# 4) Remove apostrophes, change spaces and dashes to underscores,
#    uppercase the whole thing, and add "UNRAND_" to the front.

# OBJ: The enumerations of the base type and sub type of the artefact,
# separated by a dash.  E.g., OBJ_WEAPONS/WPN_SWORD

# PLUS: The pluses of the artefact.  For an object with two pluses,
# this is specified with "plus/plus2".  For an object with just one plus,
# this is specified with "plus".

# AC:       Armour class modifier (for non-armour artefacts).
# ACC:      Accuracy modifier (for non-weapon artefacts).

#           a chance of the wielder going berserk, with the chance
#           increasing with the value of ANGRY.
# APPEAR:   Unidentified appearance of artifact.
# COLD:     Cold resistance/vulnerability.
# COLOUR:   The colour of the artifact, either as listed in defines.h
#           (e.g., LIGHTRED) or as listed under element_type in view.h
#           (e.g., ETC_FIRE)
# CURSED:   The artefact has a one-in-num chance of becoming cursed each
#           time it's equipped.
# DAM:      Damage modifier (for non-weapon artefacts).
# DESC:     Description which replaces the database (dat/descript/items.txt)
#           description of the item.
# DESC_ID:  Description which replaces the database desc or DESC when the
#           artefact is identified.
# DESC_END: String which goes at the end of the artefact's description, if
#           the item is identified.

# EV:       Evasion modifier.
# FIRE:     Fire resistance/vulnerability.

# TILE_EQ:  The file containing the equipment tile for the player doll as
#           defined in rltiles/dc-player.txt. See Tiles section above.
# VALUE:    item_value() will return this number instead of doing automatic
#           calculations to determine the value.
