# This file contains the definitions of unrandarts (and what used to be
# fixed artefacts).  util/art-data.pl translates this file into
# art-data.h, and also updates the enumeration and NUM_UNRANDARTS in
# artefact.h. C/C++ functions which give unrandarts non-standard
# behaviour are in art-func.h; util/art-data.pl scans art-func.h and
# puts the function names found into art-data.h.
#
# Each artefact definition is separated by one or more blank lines.
#
# Each artefact definition must have the NAME, OBJ and COLOUR fields.
#
# The name and appearance of each unrandart must be unique.
#
# Changing the name of an unrand will change its automatically
# generated enumeration, unless its enumeration is forced with ENUM.
#
# "ENUM: FOO" can be used to force the enumeration for an unrand to be
# "UNRAND_FOO", for cases where the automatically generated enumerations
# of different unrandarts conflict.
#
# Add new artefact definitions at the end of the file; doing so should cause
# no problems with save-file compatibility, but for tile builds it will
# cause a shift of remembered tiles (since each new unrandart needs its
# own tiles). Changing the order of the definitions will likely cause
# strange behaviour in games saved previous to the change, and deleting
# definitions will break savefile compatibility.
#
# ####### TILES #############################
#
# Each unrandart needs at the very least an item tile, and weapons and armour
# also need an equipment tile for the player doll. For the former, you can
# define the image file within this file using the keyword TILE. The files are
# assumed to be png and the syntax does not include the file type. The
# artefacts' base type decides where a tile needs to be placed. These are as
# follows:
#     Weapons: rltiles/item/weapon/artefact
#     Armour:  rltiles/item/armour/artefact
#     Rings:   rltiles/item/ring/artefact
#     Amulets: rltiles/item/amulet/artefact
#
# If the tile requires a black outline (because it would be hard to see
# otherwise) add "tilerim" to the artefact's boolean properties. Otherwise
# the image is used without modification.
#
# For the equipment tile, place the tile into the appropriate subdirectory of
# rltiles/player/ and define it in rltiles/dc-player.txt as well as here, using
# the keyword TILE_EQ. Tiles are sorted into directories by equipment slot:
#     Weapons:     rltiles/player/hand1/artefact
#     Body armour: rltiles/player/body
#     Boots:       rltiles/player/boots
#     Cloaks:      rltiles/player/cloak
#     Gloves:      rltiles/player/gloves
#     Shields:     rltiles/player/hand2
#     Helms, caps: rltiles/player/head
#
# Rings and amulets are too small to be displayed with the player doll.
#
# To begin with, placeholders (e.g. the base type tiles) are fine, but they'll
# eventually need to be replaced with proper tiles, though this is less of a
# problem for the equipment tiles.
# No checks are made for whether path or files actually exist. However, if that
# is not the case the tile compilation will fail.

# Explanation of unusual fields:

# BOOL: Turn certain boolean properties of the artefact on, with the list
# of properties separated by commas. The list includes:
#
# * blink:    Lets wearer evoke the blink ability.
# * chaotic:  Is treated as a chaotic item.
# * clarity:  Provides clarity.
# * corrode:  Randomly causes corrosion when taking damage.
# * deleted:  Never randomly generated. Should only appear in old games.
# * drain:    Causes draining when unequipped.
# * elec:     Grants electrical resistance.
# * evil:     Is treated as an evil item (hated by good gods).
# * fragile:  Is destroyed when unequipped.
# * holy:     Is treated as a holy item.
# * inv:      Lets wearer evoke invisibility ability.
# * fly:      Grants wearer flight.
# * mutate:   Causes high magical contamination when unequipped.
# * nogen:    Never randomly generated.
# * noises:   Weapon makes noises. Should be given its own set of noises
#             by making an entry in dat/database/wpnnoise.txt, with the
#             entry's key exactly the same as the weapon's name, but all
#             lowercase.
# * nospell:  Prevents wearer from casting spells.
# * notelep:  Prevents wearer from teleporting or blinking.
# * no_upgrade: Don't regenerate this item on load. Used for items with mutable
#             state, e.g. Wyrmbane's growing enchantment.
# * poison:   Grants poison resistance.
# * rcorr:    Grants corrosion resistance.
# * rmsl:     Passively repels missiles.
# * rmut:     Grants mutation resistance.
# * seeinv:   Lets wearer see invisible.
# * skip_ego: The item's ego is skipped in its inscription and description, to
#             be replaced by INSCRIP: and DBRAND: entries.
# * slow:     Randomly causes slowing when taking damage.
# * special:  Artefact is "special": can't be picked up by monsters,
#             can't be affected by Tukima's Dance.
# * tilerim:  Adds a black outline to the tile, see above section.
# * unided:   Properties start unidentified.

# DESCRIP: Description of powers of the artefact which are specific to this
# artefact, not provided by the fields in this file. Use DBRAND for unusual
# brands.
#
# The description of a power can be split across more than one line. The
# subsequent lines should be just below the first one, and should start with
# a space (with no header name). A power with a short name followed by a `:`
# will be automatically indented on the item description screen.
#
# If there are multiple powers, subsequent powers can be added with a +.
#
# Example:
# DESCRIP: Perl: It enhances your regex magic.
# + Python: It gives you a bracketing malus.

# DBRAND: Description of a brand which is specific to this artefact.
#
# The syntax for this is identical to DESCRIP.

# ENUM: Forces the artefact's enumeration literal to something specific.
# For example, "ENUM: FOO" gives the enumeration "UNRAND_FOO". The
# default enumeration is determined as follows:
#
# 1) If there's a string between double quotes, use that.
# 2) If #1 doesn't apply and the name contains " of " or " of the ",
#    use what's after that.
# 3) If neither #1 no #2 apply, use the full name.
# 4) Remove apostrophes, change spaces and dashes to underscores,
#    uppercase the whole thing, and add "UNRAND_" to the front.

# OBJ: The enumerations of the base type and sub type of the artefact,
# separated by a dash. E.g., OBJ_WEAPONS/WPN_SWORD

# PLUS: The pluses of the artefact.

# FALLBACK: if an artefact has already generated, the builder instead usually
# creates a randart with the same base type. This field allows overriding the
# base type for certain special cases (e.g. if a randart's special properties
# put it on par with a much stronger base type).

#####

# Explanation of normal fields:

# AC:       Armour class modifier (for non-armour artefacts).
# ANGRY     Each time the wielder of the weapon strikes a victim there's
#           a num-in-100 chance of the wielder going berserk.
# APPEAR:   Unidentified appearance of artefact.
# COLD:     Cold resistance/vulnerability.
# COLOUR:   The colour of the artefact, either as listed in defines.h
#           (e.g., LIGHTRED) or as listed under element_type in view.h
#           (e.g., ETC_FIRE)
# SLAY:     Slaying modifier (for non-weapon artefacts).
# DEX:      Dexterity modifier.
# EV:       Evasion modifier.

#           (1.25 normal turns).
# STEALTH:  Stealth modifier.
# STR:      Strength modifier.
# TILE:     The file containing the artefact's tile, with file type png.
#           See Tiles section above.
# TILE_EQ:  The file containing the equipment tile for the player doll as
#           defined in rltiles/dc-player.txt. See Tiles section above.
# VALUE:    item_value() will return this number instead of doing automatic
#           calculations to determine the value.
