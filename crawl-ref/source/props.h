/** \class actor     \brief Virtual base class for player and monster classes.      Contains all the properties and methods common to monsters and players. */  /** \var CrawlHashTable actor::props     \brief Properties hash table.      actor keys     public     private      player keys     public     private      monster keys     public     "wand_known" For wands, we can't simply rely on item knowledge, because     if the player has already identified the wand type, item_type_known     returns true regarding player's knowledge of this specific wand.     Thus, we track wand knowledge using this key.     If the property exists, it means the player knows the monster has a wand.     If it's true, the player also knows it's type.      private */
