Information for players of versions 0.3.4 or earlier
----------------------------------------------------

There have been many changes to the interface in the new version. Among
them:

* Swapped some command keys around:
   z         cast spell       (was Z)
   Z         zap wand         (was z)
   o         auto-explore     (was Ctrl-O)
   Ctrl-O    dungeon overview (was O)
   O         open door        (was o)
   C         close door       (was c)
   c         chop up          (was D, dissect)
   E         show experience  (was C)
   v         evoke            (was E)
   t         tell/yell        (was !)
   There is a file called "keys.pdf" in the /docs directory. It should be
   printable and contains a reference sheet for all keys used in Crawl.

* Removed the v command (view item in inventory). Its functionality is
   provided by pressing i (showing the inventory) and the letter for the
   item, at the same number of key presses.

* The chop up (formerly dissect) interface is modified: there is no
   prompt anymore for single corpses. In case of several corpses on the
   square, you may use 'c' as a synonym for yes, and 'a' will answer yes
   to this and all further corpses. In particular, all corpses in a square
   can be sacrificed with 'pca'.

* The colours of many monsters have been changed. Most notably, there are
   no darkgray monsters anymore. In case darkgray is actually better
   visible than blue on your system, you can swap these colours using
     colour: darkblue = darkgray
   or similar in the init.txt.
   Apart from that, more dangerous monsters are now generally displayed in
   lighter colours.

We are sure that all of these changes are genuine improvements. Should
your brain be hardwired to the old settings, you can effectively enforce
the 0.3.4 state by using the following options:
   : crawl.read_options('docs/034_monster_glyphs.txt')
   additional_macro_file   = docs/034_command_keys.txt
   always_confirm_butcher  = true

Note that the header of init.txt contains these lines. (It contains some 
more options for using other old settings.) The options are commented out, 
so you just need to remove the # in front in order to activate them. You 
can choose to use only part of these options. In case you decide to use 
the old keyset, be aware that D is also a synonym for 'yes' in the 
butcher interface.

In case you choose to go with the new keyset or the new butcher interface, 
you will want to look through your macro.txt file.
