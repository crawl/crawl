Internationalisation (i18n) Notes
=================================

Strings are localised by calling the localise() functions (localise.h/localise.cc).

There is an overload that allows localistion of a fixed string:
    localise("Zin will disapprove.");

There is also an overload that takes printf-style arguments, and allows the the localisation of parameterised strings:
    localise("%s hits you.", monster_name);

There is another overload that handles embedded parameters of the form @foo@ (which some pre-existing Crawl code uses).
Param values are passed in a map.
    string localise(const string& text, const map<string, string>& params, bool localise_text = true);

Many commonly called functions call localise() internally, in order to avoid the need to insert thousands of explicit calls to localise() all through the code.
These include:
- mprf, mprf_nojoin, mprf_nocap
- mpr, mpr_nojoin, mpr_comma_separated_list (but not formatted_mpr)
- functions that call mpr/mprf:
    - show_prompt
    - msgwin_prompt
    - god_speaks
    - direction_chooser::print_top_prompt (so no need to explictly localise the top_prompt data member unless it's a parameterised string)
- simple_god_message
- simple_monster_message
- msgwin_get_line, and by extension, functions that call it: 
    - msgwin_get_line_autohist
    - prompt_for_int
    - prompt_for_float
- yesno
- prompt_invent_item

The mprf* functions take printf-style arguments, which will be passed down to the printf-style localise, so they are capable of localising parameterised strings.
(However, that parameterisation has to be done in a way that will work for all languages, not just English).

mpr_comma_separated_list also handles a limited form of parameterisation.

The other functions only take a single string, and therefore can only localise fixed strings. If the string is built at runtime, it will
likely be necessary to replace that string-building with an explicit call to localise.

The functions mprf_nolocalise and mpr_nolocalise have been created for cases where localisation is not wanted.
