Enhancements:

* make screen update correctly when player vision is <2.

* Make dangerous things be shown on top of a stack.  This includes traps,
  walls of fire, etc.

* Make food acquirement give you more kinds of food.

* file locking for the high score file

* adjust EV for low levels.

* repopulate levels on the way out

* should species armour bonus work on EV instead of AC?

* make rings of fire/ice (and others?) auto identify with use

* miscast effects too weak?  Not enough of a threat, especially when used
  by gods, Zot traps, or mummies as a form of punishment.

* add toggled stealthy mode?

* print out '@' status in character dumps (might be nice to have the
  chacters status in the dump... method of death might be good as well).

* fix green crystal room so its not boring (pretty vault, just no real
  point to it currently)

* fix the summoning abuse problem properly.  Ideally, the player should
  not get piety for killing things he summoned, but should get piety
  for things that are summoned against him.

* Add a wizard debugging function to output several thousand items for 
  a particular depth (should make item frequency tuning easier).

* Perhaps races should be physically "described" (stucture or bit
  fields) to keep track of their size and physical body parts that 
  interfer with armour.  This could also be used in other ways...
  small races could be harder to hit with ranged weapons
  than larger ones, but the larger races might get a bonus
  to carrying capacity... could also probably simplify the
  extra unarmed combat attacks code

* Speaking of the character info, I really like that Linley now displays
  the weapon being wielded.  We should think about displaying all ten
  wielded/worn objects.

* Need to make sure that ghost names will be OK when long player names
  are used.

* Blink prompt is bogus (probably also happens elsewhere). Can probably
  fix this by adding a prompt argument to look_around.

* Some of the more important messages should be in color?

* The spores contaminate the food by exploding, only the 
	> explosion effect should destroy food on the ground.

	Right. Maybe this should be implemented (it shouldn't be too
	hard; fiery explosions already destroy scrolls laying on the
	floor).

	One idea I had with contaminated food was to use the it_plus2
	variable (which IIRC is currently unused for all types of
	food) to store the number of items in a stack of food which
	are contaminated. Say you have a stack of 4 meat rations, if the
	plus2 value is 1 then one is bad, 3 are good. Any operations
	carried out on the stack (eating, dropping, picking up etc)
	have a 1 in 4 chance of taking the bad ration and 3/4 of
	taking the good. A quantum thing, sort of. Poisoned food could
	be done in the same way (if there are any variables left - dam?)

	This means that contaminated food doesn't just disappear, it
	stays around to haunt you. 

	This could perhaps lead into a 'food' skill, which lets you
	cook food, get the most out of corpses, separate the good
	food from the bad etc.

* Heavy armor doesn't offer enough protection?
	>The big problem is the strange evasion modifier calculation that
	>results in armour completely destroying your EV with the 
	>double subtraction thing.

	I don't think this is so strange. It only affects chars who have
	high dodging skills, and it makes sense to me that dodging 
	effectively and wearing heavy armour should be mutually
	exclusive unless you're used to wearing heavy armour, in which
	case the evasion penalty is reduced according to your armour
	skill and the dodging skill (which can only be picked up when 
	you're wearing light or no armour) is usually ignored.

	I did it this way so that the two skills (dodging and armour)
	would rarely both be useful at the same time, so players would
	have to choose between them. Otherwise they could just practice
	both and everyone would end up the same.

	Personally, I think the double subtraction thing should be left
	in, but with the following changes to the way armour works:
	- base AC should be upped considerably, as discussed
	- the limit on the proportion of the evasion penalty removed by
	a high armour skill could be raised or scrapped (currently only
	half of the evasion penalty of a piece of body armour can be
	negated by the armour skill)

	I would have fixed these problems before I stopped working on the
	code myself, except that nobody ever complained about them and I
	didn't notice them myself.

    -- EV penalty now recovered faster, Armour skill slightly easier to
       get -- base ACs should probably still be upped (bwross)

* New spell realms (Linley doesn't like these):
	NATURE  - spells connected with some nature forces, animals and plants
e.g. summon small mammal, summon scorpions, summon elemental, passwall, 
resist <element>, create plant/fungus, charm animal/plant and so on
	
	PROTECTION - protective spells - shield, resist sth., Fire/Ice armor, 
Deflect missiles... HEALING - Cure Light/Serious/Critical Wounds, Cure 
Disease, Neutralize/Slow Poison, Heal

* DRUID class - with spells allowing him to summon animals   & plants, 
charm them, also some to work with natural forces - eg. elementals, 
resist fire..., also some healing spells - neutralize poison etc...

* Maybe some God of Nature, which offers to his believers some of Druid 
  ablities

* "write scroll" skill

* Dagger of Backstabbing - hit and Damage bonus when you are backstabbing

* purify food spell

* create water/lava pool spell, also some monsters creating this kind 
  of terrain

* Some work needs to be done for multi-user environments.
    -- some done, more could be useful (bwross)

* Targetting isn't intuitive enough?
    -- slightly improved (bwross)

* Use gdbm to save games? However gdbm won't compensate for endian 
  differences...

* Use gdmn to save bones?

* Use zlib to compress saved games?

* larger windows
    -- number of lines is now handled more dynamically, but only at
	during init or compile time (depending on NUMBER_OF_LINES) (bwross)

* multiple-windows

* Use XML for monster definitions

* Use XML for room layout/fixed levels

* Use XML for item definitions?

* moves[0], beam[0] should be simplified to use pointers to structs instead.

* Locking to prevent multiple game loads/save file overwrites?

* Allow access to the new longer high score files... add user id field (for
  multi-user systems).

* Add DEC graphics support for non-IBM machines (like nethack).

* Come up with a better save file system that will accomidate versions
  easily and involve (hopefully) one smaller file... instead of the 
  large number of current files.

* Add Food/Survival skill

* New inventory/equip/drop system

>>> // > Makes a certain sense, but I can drop any number of the healing potions
>>> // > as one action that suggests a bit more care... also I could just drop
>>> // > all of my potions and that would take an action for each stack I had,

>>> // >
>>> // 	How about a compromise where you can hit d% to drop all your food,
>>> // or d! to drop all your potions, but if you want to discriminate you have
>>> // to do them individually?
>>> 
>>> I'm wanting something a bit more featured like the nethack system (not

* Options files
   -- must keep two distinct types of options and handle them separate:
       - ones that would be loaded from a "crawlrc" file and would effect
         the players characters in a general way.
       - ones selected during the game and would be carried between 
         saves, but not to other characters the player is playing.

* fix non-magical traps
   -- should have some number of "charges" for those that shoot items...
      these should be more dangerous as well.
   -- monsters should "learn" the traps of a level. 

> Could be done with a bit array (if there is a limit of 32 traps on

> within line of sight.


* Revert/change the Elementalist spellbooks?

* Improve running code

* Carrion eating mutation
    -- like vegetarian and carnivore, only gives a preference for
       rotten meat.  Progesses with level until the character 
       can only effectively eat rotten food.

* Add rumours/fortune cookies?

* Improvements to the character dump
    -- is the current dump as verbose as wanted/too verbose?
    -- add spell failures to dump?

* Change character for throwing weapons to '(' and small armour to '['.
    -- Problem: '(' is used for dancing weapons.

* Put some limits of teleport/teleport control? Make it rarer?

* Improve artefacts to compete better with Sword of Power?  Improve
  non-sword weapons so they become more of a choice?

*  Currently possible to gain 0hp when gaining a level... should
   be safeguards added to make sure this is at least never negative,
   if not guaranteeing 1hp / level.

*  should be able to see contents of books in stores?

*  remove possibility of teleport control with the Blink spell (require
   the player to use the Control Blink spell instead).

*  merge the chardump spell listing code with the other spell listing code.

*  throw traces to target should coincide with line-of-sight better

*  item inscriptions

*  are crossbows correct?  The other launchers seem to be adding their
   skill bonuses twice

*  The Throwing skill isn't particularly useful.  You could use it for 
   throwing daggers, axes, or spears but they don't stack and are 
   heavy.

*  add some weapons/change weapon code so that non-swords are more of
   an option

    // >I was thinking that this might be a good way to increase the value of
    // >non-sword weapons.
    // 
    // .. which probably needs to be done anyway. One or two
    // suggestions for new weapons which could help:
    // 
    // - axe (just axe, no 'hand' or 'battle' there): this would be to
    // a hand axe what a long sword is to a short sword. Skills may
    // need to be adjusted (a new 'great axes' skill, covering the
    // two-handed axes? Or just condense the sword skills).
    // - Spiked flail: like a flail, but more damage and slightly
    // slower (heavier etc).
    // - Great flail/mace: two-handed versions.

    These would certainly help out a bit.  The other weapon classes were
    lacking good intermediates.  I don't think a "great axe" skill is 
    required, removing "great swords" might be correct (although it
    does add a limiting factor on the power of swords).  Having weapon
    skills where only one member of the class exists doesn't seem very
    worthwhile.  Maybe fighting style skills could be used instead...

     - 'two handed weapons' could be a skill for all two handed weapons,
       it would be used in conjunction with the appropriate weapon skill.

     - 'shields' would cover "weapon and shield" style, maybe allowing 
       for the possibility of offensive shield bashing.

     - 'unarmed combat' or 'fighting' could cover the cases where one
       or both hands are empty.  Characters not using one of the other
       styles should be able to use unarmed strikes more often and
       more efficiently.

    Potentially, you could add a bastard sword to the game.  Its hand and
    a half nature could put it in any of the above categories (if you 
    have a shield, it would be the second... if not it could be either
    of the other two).

    Of course, adding new skills has its own problems... there is already a
    shortage of space on the skills screen.

   -- add special attacks to weapons and allow them to be accessed by the
      player via SHIFT-<move> onto an adjacent monster.

- fix monster enchantments to have proper timeouts and a better structure

- score file still gets messed up from time to time... should probably 
  change the format into something that can be expanded and contains more
  information that might be printed (user id on multiuser systems, time, etc)

-- add checking for legal background colour (or just let it ignore the
   "bold" colours like it does now?)

-- change file formats and functions
    -- change score file format (see nethack for additional fields... also
       maybe a field for damage done by killing attack... could be used to
       spice up the death description (use final HP?))... also a userid
       field for MULTIUSER systems would be nice (to tell likenamed 
       charcters apart and identify the player).

-- sort out spells into separate spl-* files based on type/skill

-- make all this you.inv_*, mitm/itm stuff the same instead of 
   having conversions everywhere.

-- differentiate the good gods more

-- break up dungeon.cc more

-- a check floor for lava/water function

-- a simple "summon hostile unfriendly/random demon" spell with fewer params?

-- centralize the elemental resistance code into a single entry point that
   takes damage and type and does the appropriate things... some of the
   cases are notably special, so some extra damage cateogries might have
   to be created (ie. stepping/falling into lava is an instadeath for 
   characters with negative fire resistance, but being hit with a lava
   bolt is only extra damage).

-- functions to check for specific equipment (ie reduce checks for "!= -1")

-- move ghost/demon array into a proper structure.
