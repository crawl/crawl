TABLES OF APTITUDES

The following three tables describe all aptitudes of the various species
for the various skills. These are not necessary for winning in Crawl,
neither explicit nor implicit. The qualitative information behind this
sheet (i.e., which species is good at which tasks) can be obtained in
two other, less sophisticated ways:
- Read the species section in the manual about strengths and weaknesses.
- Look at which combinations of species and job are recommended
  (lightgrey).

If you consider figuring out such things yourself to be fun, stop
reading now. Otherwise, just go ahead. The lower a value, the better the
aptitude. 100 is the Human standard. Please note that many things affect
how quickly a character will actually learn a skill. Thus, the numbers
below are good enough for comparisons among species, but not necessarily
among skills.

The abbreviations used for the skills are:
