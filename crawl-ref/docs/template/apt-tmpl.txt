TABLES OF APTITUDES

The following three tables describe all aptitudes of the various species
for the various skills. Knowledge, neither explicit nor implicit, of these
are not necessary for winning in Crawl. The qualitative information behind
this sheet (i.e., which species are good at which tasks) can be obtained in
two other ways:
- Read the species section in the manual about strengths and weaknesses.
- Look at which combinations of species and background are recommended.

 --  no aptitude (cannot learn this skill at all)
 -5  abysmal aptitude
 -4  terrible aptitude (learning half as fast as at 0 aptitude)
 -3  very poor aptitude
 -2  poor aptitude
 -1  slightly disfavoured aptitude
  0  standard aptitude
 +1  slightly favoured aptitude
 +2  strong aptitude
 +3  very strong aptitude
 +4  outstanding aptitude (learning twice as fast as at 0 aptitude)
 +5  exceptional aptitude

There are four special values: HP, MP, Experience and Willpower.
- The HP value indicates the percentage of hit points gained per experience
  level, 100% being the Human standard.
- The MP value indicates a fixed additive modifier to magic points.
- The Experience value indicates how much experience has to be earned in
  order to gain a new experience level, +0 being the Human standard. These
  values use the same scale as the skill aptitudes.
- The Willpower value indicates resistance to many magical effects per
  experience level, +3 being the Human standard.

The abbreviations used for the skills are:
