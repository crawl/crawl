Stone Soup 0.13 (20131011)
--------------------------

0.13 highlights
---------------
* A new race: Gargoyles.
* A reimagined Skald background.
* A thorough rework of the monster set in Crypt.
* Improvements to many evokable items.
* A new item: sack of spiders.
* Massively overhauled layout generators.
* Summoning school: per-spell limits and no stair following or pulling.
* New Sprint map: linesprint.

Branches, environment
---------------------
* A new Sprint map: "|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||" by st (otherwise known as
  linesprint).
* Branches now have exactly one exit stair (except the Dungeon, which can,
  but is not guaranteed, to have more).
* Many new layouts have been added to most branches, including unique layouts
  for branches that didn't have them; and numerous tweaks and improvements
  to existing layouts.
* Vaults can now be placed at the centre of some layouts prepared to accept
  them there.
* All portal vaults entrances that time out are now announced.
* Temple overflow altars can now contain multiple altars.
* New shop type: gadget shops, which sell evokable items.
* Mechanical traps do not spawn outside of vaults.
* Zot trap effects are now only a subset of the full set of miscasts, and
  have some new unique effects - draining of wand charges and Word of Recall
  (as per ironbrand convokers).

Character
---------
* A new race: Gargoyles, with low natural HP but an impressive host of
  resistances and the ability to fly at XL14.
* Sludge elves are no more.
* The Skald background gets a reworked spellbook with four new spells:
    - Infusion grants additional melee damage costing MP with each strike;
    - Song of Slaying grants an incremental slaying bonus with every monster
      killed (of sufficient threat level);
    - Spectral Weapon creates an allied spectral clone of your weapon
      which strikes enemies in melee when you do.
    - Song of Shielding has a similar effect to Spirit Shield, trading HP
      loss for MP loss.
* Priests are no more.
* The nausea status from eating contaminated chunks has been removed;
  contaminated chunks now give less nutrition for characters that can't
  handle them.
* Stabbing skill is no more; stabs now depend upon the average of the
  character's stealth and weapon skill.
* The Traps skill is no more; all characters detect traps as though they
  had (XL/3) Traps skill.
* Chaos knights start with a +0 chaos weapon instead of a +2 normal weapon.
* New tier 2 demonspawn mutation - "magic shield", giving spirit shield
  at level one, improved magic regeneration at level two, and regenerating
  mana in place of health as a function of current magic level at level
  three.
* Deaths to acid, self-targetting, and sticky flame now credit
  the appropriate monster/spell.
* Draining a stat to zero can no longer directly kill the player; instead,
  further stat drain damages the player. The effects of a stat being at zero
  (fainting, slow actions, etc.) persist.
* Ogre hunters and artificers now start with a club instead of a short sword.

Monsters
--------
* New/reworked Crypt monsters:
    - Wraiths, shadow wraiths, and eidolons drain speed instead of XP.
    - Eidolons deal more melee damage and can cast bolt of draining.
    - Phantasmal warriors can temporarily reduce their target's magic
      resistance and can blink closer to their foes.
    - Flayed ghosts gain a smite-targetted flaying attack, dealing
      temporary damage that scales with XP and goes away when the flayed
      ghost is killed and/or enough time passes.
    - Ancient champions, formerly a vault-specific monster, are now
      full randomly-generated monsters, coming with a band of skeletal
      warriors 50% of the time.
    - Vampire mages cast vampiric draining more often, and have slightly
      higher HD and HP; they also come with a band of vampires.
    - Rotting hulks are now plague shamblers, capable of inflicting a
      "retching" status effect that prevents food consumption; they
      generate a cloud of miasma on death.
    - Spectral things move at their full base monster speed.
    - Deep dwarf death knights gain slightly better attack power and
      starting equipment, and now come with a band of undead.
    - Flying skulls get a slight HP boost and a larger attack power boost.
    - Ghouls inflict rot half as often.
    - Curse skulls are capable of out-of-LOS movement, similar to wandering
      mushrooms, but preferring to place themselves where a player needs to
      move the most to actually reach them.
    - New monster: revenants, possessing a ghostly fireball attack and
      capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm
      undead and occasionally summon spectral things.
    - New monster: lost souls, who sacrifice themselves to heal nearby
      undead creatures or assume the shape of a nearby killed living
      creature; they can be summoned by deep elf death mages.
    - Necromancers don't come with necrophages, but do some with simulacra.
    - Unborn deep dwarves are now just unborn.
    - New monster: jiangshi, who move in short bursts (like sixfirhies) and
      possess a vampiric melee attack.
* New forest-themed monsters:
    - Spriggan assassins and enchanters, who attempt to disable the player
      with blowguns and hexes respectively before moving in for the kill.
    - Wind drakes, who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and airstrike the
      player.
* Other new monsters:
    - Tengu reavers, skilled with both steel and spells; appearing in the
      late dungeon and in Vaults.
    - Deathcaps, summonable by curse toes - tougher wandering mushrooms
      with Drain Life.
* New unique: Sojobo, king of the tengu.
* Jory now spawns normally in the late dungeon, instead of being limited to
  vaults.
* Adjustments to some tier 4 demons:
    - Orange demons' sting has a 50% chance of inflicting a Weakness status,
      which reduces the player's attack damage.
    - Blue devils have a swooping attack, where they can immediately move
      adjacent to the player and attack from up to four tiles away.
    - Red devils can now hop backwards from adjacent foes to make use of their
      now-guaranteed polearms' reaching attacks.
* Adjustments to the elementals:
    - Water elementals have an asphyxiation attack which lasts as long as
      their target is next to them, and have slightly increased AC and HP.
    - Fire elementals (and fire vortices) deal pure fire damage.
* Updated spell set for several monsters:
    - Draconian shifters:
        - Banishment is dropped.
        - A new monster spell: Dimension Anchor, which temporarily prevents
          teleportation, blinking, and Phase Shift.
        - A new monster spell: Blink Allies Encircling, which blinks nearby
          allies around the target.
        - Controlled Blink is replaced with Blink Away as an emergency spell.
    - Spriggan air mages:
        - Drop Swiftness.
        - New spell: Control Winds, which manipulates clouds (including
          putting out fores fires immediately), and improves allied
          ranged weapon accuracy.
    - Spriggan druids:
        - Drop Summon Caniforms.
        - New spells: Haste Plants, which hastes nearby plant-like enemies,
          and Druid's Call, which calls wildlife from elsewhere on the level
          to aid the druid.
    - The Enchantress:
        - Banishment is banished.
        - Gains Dimension Anchor (see draconian shifter entry above), Strip
          Resistance (lowers the magic resistance of the target), and Mass
          Confusion.
    - Curse toes:
        - No more Summon Undead.
    - Deep elf summoners:

          rats, spiders, and some other things.

    - Deep elf conjurers:
        - Only one spellset (bolt of fire, bolt of cold, lightning bolt,
          bolt of draining); the spell set with sticky flame has been
          removed.
    - Gloorx Vloq:
        - No longer has Invisibility as an emergency spell.

    - Speed 8: spiny worms, snapping turtles, guardian mummies (all previously
      speed 9).
    - Speed 10: jellies (previously 9).
* Shadows can now turn invisible, allowing them to move faster and
  land a guaranteed stab attack on enemies.
* The retribution effect for killing an apis now inflicts Weakness on
  the player, instead of healing nearby hostiles.
* Giant fireflies can now signal nearby awake monsters in a manner similar to
  shouting.
* Vault wardens can seal stairways in addition to doors.
* Zombies no longer appear excessively out of depth in the early dungeon.
* Orb run monster spawns no longer include weak monsters, and now include
  Orb Guardians.
* Monster actions are now taken in order of speed, rather than any given
  monster taking all of its actions at once.

    - War dogs (replaced by wolves with essentially matching stats).
    - Deep dwarf scions, necromancers, and artificers.

    - A large number of vault-specific monsters.
* Imps and other weak monsters no longer appear in Pan.
* Nergalle appears earlier in the dungeon.
* Lamia no longer comes with a band of minions.
* Creatures other than natural creatures can now be frenzied; this causes
  them to attack anything in sight. The berserking effect of frenzy (might
  and haste effects) is limited to natural creatures.

Spells
------
* New spells:
  - Searing Ray, a level 2 conjuration replacing Force Lance in the
    Book of Conjurations that deals damage over several consecutive turns.
  - Discord, a level 8 hex that attempts to frenzy all monsters in sight.
* Summon Small Mammals now only ever summons one mammal, and is renamed to
  Summon Small Mammal as a consequence.
* 100% of teleports on the orb run are delays (up from 50%).
* Haunt adjustments:
    - Summons now fixate on their target.
    - Flayed ghosts are no longer summoned.
    - Friendlies are no longer targettable.
* Olgreb's Toxic Radiance now poisons continuously over several turns (and
  deals impact damage); it also ignores the caster's poison resistance (if
  any).
* Dragon Form is pure Transmutations (was Tmut/Fire for all but Draconians).
* Force Lance is now level 5 (was level 2), with boosted range and damage
  to match.
* Fulminant Prism now caps at 200 spellpower.
* Swiftness can be cast in water; it doesn't operate in water, but it
  grants the status (which operates as expected when out of the water).
* Summons caps are introduced. This acts on a per-spell basis, each spell
  has a fixed numerical limit for the number of summons active at any time.
  Going over this limit means your oldest summons will expire in a very
  short number of turns. Applies only to non-necromantic non-permanent
  summons.
* Temporary summons will no longer follow the player down stairs.
* Temporary summons expire when the player moves to a different level.

Items
-----
* The elemental evocation items have been reworked:
    - All no longer depend on elemental magic skill or nearby terrain, can
      summon multiple elementals, and have an XP-based recharge timer.
    - The lamp of fire fires up to three trails of flame in a given direction.
    - The fan of air elementals is now the fan of gales, and blows back
      nearby enemies.
    - The stone of earth elementals is now the stone of tremors; it causes
      rubble to fall from nearby rock, stone, or permarock walls to damage
      creatures adjacent to them, and has a chance to shaft creatures;
    - A new elemental evoker item - the phial of floods; it generates a wave
      of water which temporarily leaves a pool of water behind, and summons
      water elementals.
* The dependence of armour penalties on strength has been adjusted; there
  are no longer magic strength numbers for lowest possible penalties.
* Potions of gain <ability> have been replaced by potions of beneficial
  mutation, which grant the player a single beneficial mutation.
* Scrolls of vorpalise weapons are now scrolls of brand weapon, and can
  rebrand weapons that already have a permanent brand affixed.
* Scrolls of immolation have been reworked to inner flame everything in
  LOS.
* Lear's chain mail is now Lear's hauberk - a +27 chain mail that covers
  all armour slots other than shields and cloaks.
* The staves of energy eliminates 100% of spell hunger again, and includes
  the now-gone staff of channeling as well.
* The staff of power scales with your maximum magic power.
* Box of beasts has been reworked:
    - Has a fixed, random number of charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
    - 1/3 chance to fail on usage with no bad effects.
    - When successful, generates a chimera; a new monster with three heads.
      Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which provides
      better/stronger beasts at higher Evocations skill. The heads determine
      the attacks and abilities available to the monster.
* New "sack of spiders" item:
    - Fixed charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
    - On evoking, creates webs around you and releases spiders.
    - Number of webs and type/number of spiders scales with evocations.
* Splint mail has been removed; chain mail is now 8 AC to compensate.
* Needles of sickness have been removed.
* Manuals do not need to be read to be activated; they're always on while in
  inventory.
* The rod of striking now functions as a melee weapon - it expends charges
  to deal additional damage in melee.
* Boots of running have a -1 movement delay (was -2).
* The lantern of shadows' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations,
  and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.
* New unrand: the +4 moon troll leather armour {Spirit MP+5 Regen}.
* Adjustments to unrands:
   - Arga is now a broad axe.
   - The shield of the gong no longer has guardian spirit; it is otherwise
     unchanged.
   - The knife of accuracy and boots of the Assassin are no more.
   - The lightning scales are now +6 (was +3).
* Hammers do not generate outside of vaults.

Gods
----
* Yredelemnul no longer gifts rotting hulks / plague shamblers.

  tiles (e.g. walls in the Abyss, the Elven Halls, and the Pan disco hall).

  capable of using.

Branches, environment
---------------------
* The Hall of Blades layout has been adjusted, and now contains two weapons
  with "interesting brands" instead of just one.
* The Abyss is revamped yet again. It now contains five (still infinite)
  levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with
  different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The rune
  appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper levels.
* The Abyssal rune always appears in a vault, never lying around on the floor.
* Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss exits.
* Many Ziggurat floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few monster
  sets have been replaced entirely.
* Three new Sprint maps: "Thunderdome" by evilmike, "The Pits" and "Arena of
  Blood" both by st.

Character
---------
* Stalker is removed.
* Berserkers may choose their starting weapon.
* Gladiator no longer starts with a buckler, gets more Dodging to compensate.
* Traps are spotted (or not) deterministically based on skill level and a
  few other factors: spending more time does not help.
* Levitation and controlled flight are no more - all flight is controlled.
* Flying no longer increases carrying capacity.
* Tengu receive their movement speed bonus when flying, regardless of burden.
* Black draconians gain permanent flight (like Tengu but without the speed
  boost) at XL 14.
* Removed the hidden special cost of Spellcasting, Stealth, Evocations and
  Invocations. Aptitudes adjusted.

  coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or less
  experience to gain levels than before.

* Hill Orcs are better at Axes, worse at gaining levels.
* Tengu are better at gaining levels.
* Levels 1 and 2 of the teleportitis mutation teleport you only a limited

      more masses become visible.
    - Apocalypse crab: breathes clouds of chaos.
    - Thrashing horror: moves like a bat, tramples, and frenzies.
    - Spatial maelstrom: incorporeal vortex that turns walls into spatial

      troll pack to pursue their opponent.

      for a time or until they are killed.

      projectile that can knock monsters backwards.
    - Dazzling Spray (level 3 Conjuration/Hexes). Fires a spread of energy
      bolts that can blind creatures.
    - Iskenderun's Battlesphere (level 4 Conjuration/Charms). Creates an

-----
* Axes have a cleaving attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single
  swing (all directions except directly opposite the direction of attack,
  but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75%
  damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is reduced
  to compensate.

  a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1 damage/accuracy
  boost to replace spiked flails.

  the player will turn them into a random form (including several new forms -
  tree form, wisp form, porcupine form and fungus form).

  summons a few level-appropriate monsters.

  Trog).
* Improved fixedarts: Spear of the Botono, Robe of Night, Cloak of the Thief,
  Robe of Folly, plutonium sword.

  levels.
* Followers of Beoghites now share experience when the player scores kills.
* Yredelemnul gives a small amount of piety for desecrating holy remains.

  from the (M)emorization screen), partially based on your elemental skills.
