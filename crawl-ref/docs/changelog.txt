Stone Soup 0.33 (through 0.33-a0-570-f9d81107089)
-------------------------------------------------

Highlights
----------
* New skill and background: Forgewrights, building many explosive constructs.
* Yet more monsters and decorations distributed throughout the Dungeon.

Branches, Environment
---------------------
* New decorations:
  * Walkable: caches of baked goods, floral vases (sometimes broken), flower and
    garden patches, fountains of eyes, fur piles, infernal standards, mops and
    buckets (sometimes bloodied), mourning vases, and orcish standards.
  * Solid: enigmatic dynamos and nascence circuits.
* Frail pillars of rime can be found in Cocytus.
* Walking over fountains now has a chance to produce flavour messages partially
  related to one's god, depending on the fountain's contents and the absence
  of nearby hostile enemies.
* Ziggurats have even more exponential scaling for those doing multiple
  ziggurats.
* Sprint VII ("The Pits") has been rescaled and renewed heavily, with many more
  monster options and mildly-less-aggressive earlier chamber difficulty scaling.

Character
---------
* New skill: Forgecraft, used for Forgecraft spells.
  - Most species have Forgecraft apts similar to their Summoning apts,
    with the exceptions of Mountain Dwarves, Coglins, Yellow Draconians (all
    +2), Barachi (+1), Demonspawn, Felids (all -1), Ghouls, Minotaurs, and Tengu
    (all -2).
* New background: Forgewright, which starts with a +0 hammer (a reskinned mace),
  a potion of magic, and a variety of Forgecraft spells.
* Reavers now start with knowledge of Rending Blade.
* Summoners start with knowledge of Eringya's Surprising Crocodile and Summon
  Seismosaurus Egg instead of Summon Blazeheart Golem or Lightning Spire.
* New mutations:
  * efficient magic, which makes spells cost 1 less (to a minimum of 1 MP).
  * ephemeral shield, which gives +7 SH briefly after spells and invocations.
  * time-warped blood, which hastes some of your allies when you fall below 50%
    health, and can only be used again after returning to full health.
* Berserk players are now immune to fear.
* Constructs the player makes with their own Forgecraft spells can be
  nonviolently deconstructed by pressing ctrl+[direction] while adjacent.

Gods
----
* Ashenzari's curse of Companions now supports Forgecraft as well as its prior
  skills of Summoning and Necromancy.
* Cheibriados worshippers are never hasted by potions of haste, and can't
  enter penance by deliberately drinking potions of haste.
* Cheibriados's wrath has been simplified.
* Dithmenos's shadow mimic also works for Forgecraft spells, creating a shadow
  turret that can fire through allies.
* Xom has received more adjustments:
  * Xom's bazaars have more variety and are less common.
  * Polymorph and draining effects are less dangerous early on.
  * New actions: hyperbuff weak ally, burn webs.
* All three good gods that care about injuring allies now consistently don't
  care about injuring mindless non-living allies (like Forgecraft's).

Interface and Options
---------------------
* Examining equipment and talismans now can show the changes to the player's
  spell success chances for each spell if they switched to using that item.
* Examining monsters shows if they can open doors.
* Spell range is now indicated with numbers instead of diagrams.
* Default target-picking behaviour for spells, abilities, and items has been
  improved: it is now more consistent at avoiding the player or their allies
  when aiming harmful area effects and choose more sensible default aims for
  some utility effects.
* Ranged autofight should no longer sometimes cast spells at invalid targets
  (such as Dispel Undead against living monsters in melee).
* Non-monster UI now darkens quote text and can rarely contain flavour text
  instead of just quotes.

Items
-----
* New weapon: partisans, uncommon one-handed polearms with higher base damage
  than demon tridents and the longest swing delay of any one-handed weapon.
* Darts of dispersal are now darts of disjunction, which now repeatedly blink
  a target each turn for several turns and deal damage with each blink.
* +Invis, Harm, and Rampage artifact properties can now be found on talisman
  randarts.

Monsters
--------
* New monsters:
  * Alderkings, fae trees and necromantic masters of Depths.
  * Fravashi, mid-tier warrior-summoning angels.
  * Nekomata, self-cloning ranged cat demons for Pan.
  * Oni incarcerators, Manifold Assault users for Gehenna.
  * Wyrmholes, terrifying relocations drakes for Depths and rarely Zot.
* Returning monster: ironbound beastmasters, now with a passive animal and slime
  hasting aura plus the ability to throw bolas to bind foes in place.
* Apises now have a passive aura that doubles the health of other monsters.
* Arcanists now have more health and EV.
* Ball pythons deal less damage.
* Bennu deal more holy damage.
* Blood saint and Mnoleg Call of Chaos now can temporarily double monster hp.
* Creeping infernos now have a fairly large amount of health, move normally
  towards the player, and deal more damage when they explode.
* Crystal echidnas deal more damage and are now speed 13.
* Crystal guardians deal more damage.
* Elementals in general now have animal intelligence instead of being mindless.
* Endoplasms no longer have rPois.
* Iron golems now have less health and EV.
* Mutant beasts count as chaotic.
* Occultists now have more health and EV.
* Quicksilver oozes have been renamed, rethemed, and retiled to void oozes.
* Searing wretches can now swim across lava.
* Sin beasts now come in duos in Pan.
* Sky beasts lose electric damage and random invisibility to instead deal damage
  depending on the number of open spaces next to what they hit in melee.
* Thermic dynamos and undying armouries reward more experience.
* Water elementals and elemental wellsprings are now amorphous, gaining the
  same immunity to nets, constriction, and webs jellies have.
* Mindless non-living monster allies consistently don't get angry at the player
  for being hit, and do not disappear if they were summoned or constructed.

Species
-------
* Mountain Dwarf Summoning apt is lowered from 0 to -2.
* Enhancer staves are now one-handed instead of two-handed for spriggans and
  kobolds.

Spells
------
* New spell school of Forgecraft: thematically a school of constructing bombs,
  cannons, and limited automata, mechanically a mostly-ally school more focused
  on direct damage and blasting than Summoning, and design-wise a new means of
  providing more cross-school spells and pivoting options.
* New Forgecraft spells:
  - Kinetic Grapnel (L1 FC): A weak physical projectile connected to one's
    weapon that guarantees the next melee attack hits and deals extra damage.
  - Construct Spike Launcher (L2 FC): Builds a spike launcher in a random
    adjacent wall, which launches spikes at random adjacent targets.
  - Launch Clockwork Bee (L3 FC): Targets a monster to wind up and ready a
    clockwork bee over several turns, which can be rewound up when it collapses.
  - Rending Blade (L4 FC / Conj): Temporarily transforms all of the caster's mp
    into a blade that pierces through enemies whenever the caster attacks.
  - Nazja’s Percussive Tempering (L5 FC): A healing and buffing spell for
    Forgecraft summons that also produces an ally-avoiding physical explosion.
  - Alistair's Walking Alembic (L5 FC / Alch): A summon that vents poisonous
    fumes as it attacks to brew various beneficial potion effects.
  - Fortress Blast (L6 FC): A highly-damaging blast that takes several turns to
    charge up and pins the caster in place, but which solely scales off of AC.
  - Forge Phalanx Beetle (L6 FC): A summon that always tries to stay by the
    caster's side and protects them with an AC boost if adjacent.
  - Forge Monarch Bomb (L6 FC / Fire): Creates a bomb factory that launches
    bomblets on top of enemies, both of which only detonate on recast.
  - Diamond Sawblades (L7 FC): Places up to four sawblades on diagonals around
    the caster that shred everything around them each turn.
  - Splinterfrost Shell (L7 FC / Ice): Raises up several sturdy walls around
    the player that fire off as heavily damaging icicle salvos if broken.
  - Platinum Paragon (L9 FC): A metallic apotheosis of a single ally that
    replicates a given artefact weapon, blocks attacks for the caster, does
    extra attacks with player attacks, and can hit large areas by recasting the
    spell when charged-up.
* The following spells have moved to Forgecraft:
  - Summon Lightning Spire: now "Forge Lightning Spire", Summ/Air -> FC/Air.
  - Summon Blazeheart Golem: now "Forge Blazeheart Golem", Summ/Fire -> FC/Fire.
  - Animate Armour: now "Awaken Armour", Summ/Earth -> FC/Earth.

  - Hellfire Mortar: Fire/Earth -> FC/Fire/Earth.
* New other spells:
  - Eringya's Surprising Crocodile (L4 Summ): Creates temporary shallow water
    and a lunging crocodile all at once to drag an enemy and the caster back.
  - Summon Seismosaurus Egg (L4 Summ / Earth): Creates an egg that will hatch
    into a mighty dinosaur if the caster stays next to it with visible enemies.
* Spell changes:
  * Awakened Armours now equip a replica of the body armour they're echoing.
  * Battlespheres now target the most proportionally damaged foe, if possible.
  * Hellfire Mortar now scales heavily with spellpower, deals more damage,
    has longer mortar range, and pushes back singular flying foes.
  * Lightning Spires now target the furtherest-away foe, if possible.
  * Maxwell's Portable Piledriver can now be aimed and can push a connected
    line of lined-up enemies all at once.
  * Mercury Vapours is now Poisonous Vapours, moved to level 1, no longer
    inflicts Weak, inflicts less poison status, and deals a small amount of flat
    AC-ignoring damage against targets without rPois.
  * Rimeblight now chains to two other targets on cast and now reliably spreads
    on death instead of also spreading through its explosions.
  * Sting is now Mercury Arrow, moved to level 2, no longer inflicts the poison
    status (but still partially checks rPois), and gains Mercury Vapours'
    previous HD-check area-of-effect Weak status.
  * Teleport Other is now smite targetted.

Stone Soup 0.32.1 (20240925)
----------------------------

Bugfix release
--------------
* Fix blockable beam attacks from monster spells being blocked 100% of the
  time.
* 40 other bug fixes, interface improvements, and documentation updates.

Stone Soup 0.32.0 (20240829)
----------------------------

Highlights
----------
* Beogh, Dithmenos, Yredelemnul, and Makhleb have been substantially revamped.
* Since everybody can become orcs, reworked Mountain Dwarves replace Hill Orcs.
* New species: Coglins, dual-wielding gizmo-inventing goblins in exosuits.
* More new spells, aimed at new school combinations and higher levels.
* Many more new and revamped monsters and decorations throughout the Dungeon.

Artefacts
---------
* New and returning unrands:
  - Returning: Brilliance, an eveningstar of foul flame, which inflicts
    reduced damage to unholy foes and extra damage to holy foes.
  - Returning: Sword of the Doom Knight, which loses pain brand to instead
    make its targets lose 10% of their maximum health on hit.
  - New: Charlatan's Orb, an orb which boosts your other skills by 20% of your
    base Evocations but has the translocations and stealth downside of the real
    Orb of Zot.
  - New: Gloves of the Gadgeteer, fragile gloves that boost evoker recharge
    rate, wand damage, and give a chance to save wand charges on use.
* The Cloak of the Thief is now +0, but gives noise suppression instead of
  random bursts of fog and no longer gives negative slaying.
* Randart MP bonuses and maluses now range from 4 to 12, instead of always
  being fixed at 9.

Branches, Environment
---------------------
* Crypt now contains more item rewards throughout its levels.
* Troves no longer ask Draconians to offer dragon scales.
* Ziggurats now scale up their enemy choices and counts up much faster
  if one dares to dive through multiple ziggurats on the same character.
* All bazaar portals are timed now.
* Quite a few new decorative features have been added to many a vault:
  - Several new types of decorative statue: silver statues,
    scintillating statues, mystic cages, and magic conduits.
  - A new decorative wall type: bedevilled crystal.
  - Completely-decorative caches of fruits and meat, which may occasionally
    be snacked upon when walked over.
  - Piles of debris, stony wreckage that crumbles away on a delay after
    being hit.
  - Sacred lotuses, extremely resilient but entirely harmless plants.
* Miasma clouds deal more damage to monsters and slow them for longer.
* Rain no longer can create deep water.
* Skeletons no longer decay.

Character
---------
* Only players without weapons can punch with their offhand.
* Player constriction no longer deals ramping-up damage.
* Removed mutations: noise dampening.
* Undead and demonic players can wield weapons of holy wrath, but the brand is
  disabled for them. The same applies to good god-worshipping players who wield
  weapons of foul flame.
* The player can now be Blinded, which gives them a flat chance to miss with
  any dodgeable effect that increases with their distance from the target they
  are aiming at.
  - Wands of Light now Blind the player instead of inflicting Confusion.
* The Frozen status now lasts a bit longer, inflicts a heavier movement penalty,
  and no longer prevents the player from being hit with Flash Freeze.
* Background changes:
  - Necromancers now start with Soul Splinter instead of Necrotise, as well as
    a dagger and knowledge of Grave Claw.
  - Hedge Wizards now know Grave Claw instead of Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot and
    start with additional Conjurations and Necromancy skill.
  - Wanderers can now start with talismans and Shapeshifting skill, and those
    that start with throwing items will usually start with more of them. Logic
    for giving suitable skill levels and items has been improved in multiple
    cases.

Gods
----
* Beogh has been completely overhauled, becoming the god of collective
  pariahs and outcasts. All species may elect to worship Beogh and become orcs
  when at low HP in front of orc priests. Most abilities are also changed:
  - Orc apostles, scaling throughout the game, will challenge the player with
    their own followers, unalterable artefact equipment, and potent mystic
    might. Forfeiting their challenge by leaving the floor inflicts penance,
    which only dismisses worshippers' followers and disables their invocations.
  - Shortly after defeating apostles, worshippers can recruit up to three
    apostles to follow them at a time. Beogh now will automatically revive those
    apostles if they die, but only after the player gains sufficient piety.
  - Other encountered orcs are pacified instead of recruited.
  - Beogh gains a new 5* ability, Blood for Blood. This can only be invoked
    on top of an orc apostle's corpse, and summons a large amount of orcs both
    immediately around the player and around the edges of the screen over time.
* Dithmenos has been completely overhauled, becoming the god of actors,
  thieves, and everyone else who works in the shadows. They no longer count as
  evil, and have replaced nearly all of their active and passive abilities.
  - 1*: Passive noise dampening, halving all noise made around the player.
  - 2*: A passive shadow mimic, which now casts differing spells based on the
        spell schools of spells cast to now cover all spell types, deals more
        damage with weapons scaling to XL, and also lingers around afterwards.
  - 3*: Shadowslip, which instantly swaps worshippers' places with a lingering
        shadow and misleads foes into targeting the shadow for a while instead.
  - 4*: Aphotic Marionette, which forces an enemy with spells to instantly cast
        random conjurations at other enemies or give buffs & summons to the
        player.
  - 5*: Primordial Nightfall, which reduces one's line of sight to zero, with
        line of sight gradually coming back over the duration.
* Yredelemnul has been significantly overhauled.
  - Yred now uses a somewhat conventional piety system again, though followers
    have to obey the rules of raising the black torch.
  - Followers of Yred get an umbral aura around them that grows as they gain
    piety, and zombies are passively animated only in the umbra aura.
  - Yredelemnul grants the following active abilities:
      - 0*: Raise the Black Torch, which enables piety gain, but which can only
            be used once per floor and only lasts until the player leaves the
            floor. Starting at 1*, this ability also summons scaling undead
            allies.
      - 2*: Hurl Torchlight, which mights undead while damaging most others.
      - 4*: Bind Soul, which now temporarily flays the player until the
            binding is successful and heavily scales the soul's HP with invo.
      - 5*: Fathomless Shackles, which binds a large area centered on the
            player and damages over time while vampirically draining foes.
      - Removed abilities: Dark Bargain, Drain Life.
* Makhleb has been significantly revamped.
  - Minor and Major Destruction have been merged into a single ability: Unleash
    Destruction. Earned at 2*, it costs more HP than Major Destruction, but no
    piety.
  - At 4* the player will receive one of 4 random upgrades to their Unleash
    Destruction ability. These upgrades, themed after each of the 4 Hells, grant
    additional effects and elements to your Destruction as well as allow it to
    pierce enemies.
  - Lesser and Greater Servant have been merged into a single ability: Infernal
    Servant. Earned at 3*, this costs an amount of piety between Lesser and
    Greater Servant. Many more types of demons can be summoned by this ability
    and the quality of demon increases with Invocations skill. It is no longer
    possible to reduce the chance of a hostile demon, but the player will always
    receive a friendly one at the same time.
  - At 6*, the player is offered a one-time choice between 3 different Infernal
    Marks which they may brand themselves with. These Marks grant powerful
    effects so long as the player continues to worship Makhleb:
    - Mark of Haemoclasm: Gives all slain enemies a chance to explode in a
      shower of gore upon death. This explosion may cause a chain reaction if it
      kills something.
    - Mark of the Legion: Replaces Infernal Servant with Infernal Legion, which
      summons a swarm of lower-level demons over time. You may fire Unleash
      Destruction freely through these allies.
    - Mark of Carnage: Infernal Servants appear next to enemies instead of the
      player and arrive in a large explosion of Destruction.
    - Mark of Annihilation: Replaces Infernal Servant with Globe of
      Annihilation, which fires a slow-moving homing projectile that explodes
      in a massive blast of hellish Destruction.
    - Mark of the Tyrant: Infernal Servants last much longer and killing enemies
      will buff them with Haste, Might, Regeneration, or Brilliance. At high
      Invocations skill, it becomes possible to summon even Hell Sentinels.
    - Mark of the Celebrant: Unleash a flurry of blood arrows at nearby enemies
      whenever the player falls below 50% of their max HP, but does not recharge
      until they are fully healed once more.
    - Mark of Execution: Upon killing an enemy in melee, there is a chance to
      temporarily take on the appearance of an Executioner, gaining a strong
      auxiliary blade attack and rampage. This effect lasts indefinitely, so
      long as the player continues attacking.
    - Mark of Atrocity: Both the damage and HP cost of Unleash Destruction now
      increases with the number of times in a row it is used. Upon the 4th use
      in a row, a huge barrage of empowered Destruction will be fired at many
      enemies in sight.
    - Mark of the Fanatic: Gives the player the Vessel of Slaughter ability,
      temporarily transforming them into a demonic avatar of Makhleb and greatly
      increasing their power and durability. But when the form ends, they will
      be forced to fight their way out of the Crucible of Flesh as a cost!
* Xom has received significant adjustments and many new effects.
  - Summoned monsters (both friendly and hostile) now scale with the player's
    XL, resulting in fewer unfair encounters at low XL and fewer harmless ones
    at high XL. A much greater variety of creatures can now be summoned.
  - Xom can now transport sufficiently-wealthy players to a curious bazaar where
    an assortment of spells and consumables Xom finds amusing may be purchased
    (as well as occasionally a chaos-branded unrand weapon).
  - Many other new Xom effects have been added, such as planting a garden,
    creating a safe adventurer enclosure, teaching rats how to chant Word of
    Recall, and summoning a fleet of living Force Lance spells.
  - Xom wrath now causes hostile effects of much greater intensity than those
    experienced while worshipping.
* Both Beogh and Yred's recall abilities are now instant.
* Jiyva now prevents all harm players could do to all jellies and slimes,
  instead of punishing them whenever they did so. Fedhas now also prevents
  players from doing harm to friendly plants.
* Nemelex is now a chaotic (but not evil) god.
* Okawaru's Duel now heals the player for half their missing health when used,
  but resets their HP and MP back to whatever they were before entering, once
  the duel is complete. It costs half as much piety and is now usable in Sprint.
* Qazlal's Upheaval and Disaster Area no longer hit the player nor any of
  their elemental allies.
* Cheibriados' Step From Time ability is now significantly more likely to result
  in monsters wandering away from the player's location, and monsters can no
  longer act before the player takes a subsequent action.
* Kikubaaqudgha's Torment ability has been replaced with Sign of Ruin, which
  applies a temporary status effect to a group of enemies that causes them to
  suffer Draining and also one of Weak, Blind, or Slow whenever they take melee
  damage.
* Vehumet's range extension now applies to Hailstorm, Frozen Ramparts, Eringya's
  Toxic Bog, and any eligible spells cast by the player's Spellforged Servitor.
* Vehumet's second spell gift is now level 2-3 instead of 1-2.
* The Shining One's Divine Shield ability has been reworked. It now provides a
  100% block chance for the next several attacks after using it. Ranged
  projectiles will be reflected and melee attackers have a high chance to become
  blinded.
* Makhleb, Vehumet, and the Shining One are now much more likely to restore
  HP or MP on eligible kills made while at low piety.
* Trog's Brothers in Arms ability no longer costs extra piety in Sprint.
* Most gods now comment upon or otherwise influence the player's death.

Interface and Options
---------------------
* Examining a monster with 'xv' now displays more accurate and detailed
  information about a monster's damage (especially with weapons) and your chance
  to hit them.

Items
-----
* New evoker: Gell's Gravitambourine, which pulls all monsters in a large
  radius close together and then binds them in place for several turns.
* Dispersal darts are now much more likely to blink their targets away
  from the thrower.
* Condenser vanes now reroll misery clouds if the good gods would block
  their creation, rather than placing nothing as a result.
* Randart launchers can now generate with Chaos or Holy brands.

Lua
---
* A new crawl.stack() function that returns a backtrace string for either the
  current lua execution stack or that of a coroutine given as an argument.

Monsters
--------
* Uniques:
  - Revamped: Arachne has been exiled out of the Spider Nest, now appearing
    a bit later in games without Spider's Nest, with a Greater Ensnare spell
    and an orb spider band.
  - Revamped: Blork the orc is now Blorkula the Orcula, both vampire and orc.
    He now casts a wider spread of conjurations and can delay death by
    becoming a rainbow swarm of vampire bats.
  - Revamped: Wiglaf has returned, gaining a randart hat, and dropping Okawaru
    invocations of Haste for Hellfire Mortar.
  - New: Xak'krixis, a formicid Royal Expeditionary Alchemist, found solely in
    the Spider Nest. They have Ignite Poison and a version of Fulminant Prism
    that doesn't hurt allies.
  - Reflavoured: Nergalle is now an archivist, and Ijyb is now an ex-Coglin
    artificer.
* New monsters:
  - Marrowcudas, early-D skeleton fish that summon swarms of themselves
    whenever they hit foes.
  - Obsidian bats, Orcish Mines stone bats which summon demonic animals
    whenever they hit foes.
  - Polterguardians, Vaults geists that give their allies Repel Missiles.
  - Scrub nettles, which fire partially-irresistible poison stings.
  - Thermic dynamos, Elven Halls vortex-engines that wield both hits and
    rebounding bolts of fire and ice.
  - Undying armouries, late Vaults terrors that hurl dancing weapons and
    grant temporary copies of the same weapon to their allies.
* Other monster changes:
  - Arcanists now cast Searing Ray instead of Force Lance.
  - Crystal guardians and crystal echidnas no longer fire rebounding bolts of
    fire or ice, and instead have crystallizing shots that inflict Vitrify.
  - Deep elf elementalists cast Hoarfrost Cannonade instead of Freezing Cloud.
  - Deep elf high priests give a long duration brilliance buff to every ally
    in their sight, rather than using an aura of brilliance.
  - Demonspawn Black Suns have been renamed to Soul Scholars and their Black
    Mark spell has been replaced with Sign of Ruin (which functions like the new
    Kikubaaqudgha invocation).
  - Demonspawn corrupters now summon thunderhulks instead of vault sentinels.
  - Draconian monster adjustments: yellow draconians have acidic bites,
    white draconians have more damaging breath, and stormcallers no longer are
    hurt by their own Upheavals.
  - Glowing orange brains are now reluctant to move closer to their foes and
    having an innate aura of brilliance affecting their allies.
  - Guardian serpents and draconian shifters' Blink Allies Encircling now
    blinks over 3 to 6 allies as is possible, instead of always 8.
  - Hell beasts have become sin beasts, gaining HD and antimagic attacks.
    Geryon's (hell -> sin) beast summoning has been weakened in exchange.
  - Monster shadows are now called shadowghasts.
  - Necrophages are weaker and now only appear from Yred's summonings.
  - Norris now casts Draining Gaze instead of Brain Bite.
  - Ophanim now passively irresistibly inflict Mark on all those they see.
  - Worldbinders now summon ironbound frosthearts instead of thunderhulks and
    their summons have a longer duration.
  - The Serpent of Hell has been adjusted to have more appropriate breath
    attacks in Dis, Gehenna, and Tartarus.

* Monster constriction is now more difficult to escape via moving, but blinks
  now always work as an escape.
* Monster repel missiles now acts as a flat +15 effective EV against
  projectiles, rather than scaling heavily to the monster's own EV.
* Player ghosts now can cast many additional low-level and mid-level spells.
* Monsters put to sleep through effects like Ensorcelled Hibernation cannot be
  woken by any means until after the player's next action.
* Removed monsters: burning bushes, lorocyprocas.

Species
-------
* New species: Coglins, goblins in mechanical exoskeletons. Features:
  - Their exoskeletons allow them to dual wield, but innately take a few
    swings to rev up to normal damage.
  - They can't wear jewellery, but at XL 14 they can choose to invent one of
    three gizmos that passively provide resists and unique benefits.

    such as scrolls of fear.
  - In menus for equipping and using items, a toggle allows switching between
    item type.

  - The `*` menu for Firing is now used to select items to toss away.

    butterflies. Alternates with scrolls of fog.

  unoccupied space on the screen with poison clouds for 10-20 turns.

    of Anguish on those hit, making them take damage when dealing it.
  - The +3 mountain boots {steadfast, rC+}. Prevents the player from being
    involuntarily moved by physical means (trampling, shafts, harpoons, etc.).
  - New unrand: the +5 lochaber axe, which cleaves through all foes in reaching
    range. Uses the higher of the player's Polearms and Axes skill.

  - Amaemon the Diabolical Poisoner, a poison-themed demonspawn unique
    appearing with a band of orange demons in mid-D, early Lair, and Orc:1.
  - Lodul the Thundrous, an ironbound thunderhulk sent to patrol outside the
    Vaults. Appears in late D with a band of fellow ogres.

    Strike, doing extra damage when constructs are adjacent to the target.
    Wields a valuable weapon. Appears searching Vaults:1-4, Elf, and Crypt.
  - Parghit the Mighty, an "alt-timeline" version of Pargi with extremely high
    regeneration and enchanted golden dragon scales. Appears in late Depths and
    Zot.
  - Josephina the Ice-Lich, an "alt-timeline" version of Josephine with
    Seracfall and a band of simulacra along side Ghostly Fireball. Appears in

    of doom hounds. Appears in Depths, Crypt, and Zot.
  - Vv the Exile, an fire/ice spellcaster with Creeping Frost, Eruption, and
    Pyroclastic Surge. Appears in Depths, Crypt, and Zot.
* Monster move energy is no longer randomized.
* Monsters gain a 1/3 chance to gain a free attack on a player moving away from
  them. Wu Jian martial attacks & rampaging give immunity, and monsters that
  don't move fast enough to follow you can't attack.

  distortion melee. Found guarding valuable places in the abyss.
* Gnoll shamans are renamed gnoll bouda, and have a new spell set.
* Animated Armour now flies.
* Monster wand power is reduced.

Spells
------
* Necromancy reworked:
  - New Spell: Necrotize (L1 Necromancy). Necrotize deals damage identically to
    the old Pain spell, but additionally gives the monster a short-lived status
    that causes it to animate as a skeleton on death (if it has a skeleton).
  - Animate Dead reworked: for a duration after being cast, the dead have a
    power-dependent chance of rising as allied zombies. The zombies are
    permanent until the player leaves the level or re-casts Animate Dead.
  - Simulacrum is now a smite-targeted spell that gives an irresistible status.
    Monsters that die with this status spawn a power-dependent number of
    simulacra.

    cast, dead monsters have a chance of producing deadly miasma.
  - Death Channel cannot be re-cast while active.

  to cast as a normal spell. Its range and accuracy are increased.
* Airstrike's damage bonus from empty space around the target is doubled.
* Irradiate now causes dangerous contamination in 3-4 casts (was 4-5).
* Flame Wave and Sticky Flame now do roughly 25% more damage.
* Ozocubu's Refrigeration and Freezing Ramparts now check AC, but do more
  damage. Refrigeration also now does reduced damage to creatures adjacent to
  others, but no longer applies -Potion to the caster.
* Hex miscasts now only slow the player, instead of also cancelling effects.
* Removed: Animate Skeleton, Pain, Excruciating Wounds.

Tiles
-----

Interface and Options
---------------------
* WebTiles now has a clickable action panel, similar to the local tiles
  inventory panel. This UI element by default shows tactically-relevant
  consumables, and comes with a number of configuration options (see the
  various `action_panel...` options, or right-click on the X).
* Mutation descriptions can now be inspected in the mut(A)tion menu.
* Most abilities now have targeters (similar to spell targeters). These are
  configurable via the `force_ability_targeter` option, and spell targeter
  configuration is moved to `force_spell_targeter`.
* Many improvements to menus and popups:
  - Arrow key navigation and selection is available in many more menus. This
    can be disabled with the new option `menu_arrow_control` for the classic
    roguelike experience. Shift-arrows replace arrows as the binding to scroll
    by a single line. (Console users: not all terminals support these keycodes
    on default settings.)
  - The quiver menu has a mode that uses hotkeys from the items/spells/abilities
    it is showing.
  - The stash search menu more clearly differentiates items that can be
    traveled to, and has a number of interface improvements. The closest
    (travelable) search result is always available via the enter key.
  - Description popups have been improved and actions in these popups are
    now activatable using the mouse on webtiles.
  - Improvements and bugfixes to many other menus.
* WebTiles mouse support is expanded.
* WebTiles supports virtual keyboards on touch devices, configurable via the
  `tile_web_mobile_input_helper` option. There have also been a number of
  improvements to rendering on touch devices. (Caveat: these changes are aimed
  at tablets, not phones.)
* Console:
  - A new console option `bold_brightens_foreground=force` lets bold be applied
    to bright foreground colors even in 16-color mode.
  - A popup accessible via ! in the help screen shows current terminal and
    console settings, and attempts to indicate misconfiguration. (PuTTY users
    may find this particularly helpful.)
* A small number of options are automatically saved across games based on their
  value in the relevant in-game user interface. These include
  `default_manual_training`, `quiver_menu_focus` (for the new quiver menu
  modes), and several of the action panel settings, which can be edited by
  right-clicking on the panel close button.
* On MacOS local games, a game menu option will reveal the rc file in the
  Finder.
* The inventory-full autopickup prompt now has an "(A)lways ignore" choice.
* Webtiles chat can be closed, as well as opened, via F12.

Items
-----
* New item type: orbs, occupying the shield slot.
  - Orbs give no SH and impose no shield penalty, but always come with an ego.
  - Orb egos are all new:
    * Light: a radius 3 halo.
    * Wrath: *Rage (20% chance to berserk on melee hit).
    * Mayhem: chance to frenzy a monster in sight after a kill, causing them
      to wildly attack friends and foes alike ala the Discord spell.
    * Guile: reduces Will by ++ for both the wearer and those they try to hex.
    * energy: gives a source of passive channeling, which gives a chance to
      refund the MP of a cast spell and a chance to backfire. Backfires cause
      confusion or Int drain. Scales with Evocations.
* New glove ego: infusion, spending 1 MP per melee hit to add extra damage.
* New unrand: the +3 Mad Mage's Maulers {Infuse+∞ RegenMP Int-3}. These use all
  available MP to give proportional bonus damage to a melee hit.
* New unrand: the dreamshard necklace {*Dream}. On receiving a lethal or
  near-lethal hit, the dreamshard necklace shatters, averting the blow, healing
  the player, releasing dream allies, and fog. Otherwise does nothing.
* New "early-game" unrandarts, unlikely to appear after the early game:
  - Delatra's gloves. These gloves heal the wearer for drinking unknown potions
    and give the wearer MP for reading unknown scrolls.
  - The woodcutter's axe is a vorpal +8 war axe that always swings at 10 aut
    regardless of skill and speed modifiers.
  - The staff of the Meek is a +7 quarterstaff of protection that gives extra
    AC when below 55 HP.
  - Throatcutter is a +7 long sword of draining with a 1/3 chance to instantly
    kill foes that are below 21 HP.
* Shields and armour:
  - Shield penalties scale linearly with skill, completely disappearing at skill
    27. The size of the penalty depends on the shield's encumbrance rating and
    species size factors.
  - Shields are no longer affected by Str, only Dex.
  - Armour and shields no longer impose to-hit penalties.
* Riposte is removed from long blades and base damage is increased.
* The skill requirements for minimum delay for executioner's axes and bardiches
  are reduced to 24; for triple swords the requirement is reduced to 22.
* *Rage now causes berserk on 20% of hits. This chance stacks linearly among
  items and with the berserkitis mutation. Certain unrands grant a higher
  chance.
* Evokable berserk is removed as an artefact property.
* The generation of throwing ammunition is reduced.
* Wand generation is reduced.
* The electrocution brand triggers 25% less often.
* One '+' of regen is reduced to 0.8 HP/turn (was 1.0 HP/turn).
* MPRegen amulets are buffed to 0.4 MP/turn (was 0.25 MP/turn).
* The archery ego is renamed to 'hurling' and now only applies to throwing.
* Unrandart tweaks:
  - The staff of Battle now triggers the battlesphere on melee hits (in addition
    to the usual spell trigger).
  - The robe of Clouds' thunder cloud ability is now passive, placing storm
    clouds on enemies within range 2 each turn.
  - Leech no longer has *Rage, and now has Harm and Drain.
  - The necklace of bloodlust now gives a 50% chance to go berserk on hit.
  - The Zealot's sword now gives a 20% chance to go berserk on hit (up from
    5%).
  - The hat of the bear spirit gives a 20% chance to go berserk on hit,
    increases the bonus HP from going berserk, and reduces the slow duration
    after. It no longer has rN+.
  - The ring of the Mage is now a ring of Wizardry and Archmagi.
  - The autumn katana loses Clarity and gains a chance to manifold assault on
    hit.
  - The glaive of Prune turns the wielder into a prune when paralysed,
    petrified, or asleep, halving the damage received for the duration.
  - Lear's Hauberk is reduced to +18 (was +27).
  - The trident of the Octopus King loses +Will.
  - Wucad Mu now counts as 1.5 sources of channeling. This means it is 1.5x as
    likely to refund MP, and the probability of backfiring is reduced.
  - The robe of Misfortune loses Contam and Drain.

Branches, Environment
---------------------
* Altar changes:
  - A faded altar places with a very high chance on D:1-3.
  - A single random altar to a Temple god places with low chance on D:2.
  - Other guaranteed Temple god altars have been shifted to D:3-10, from D:2-9.

  - Diinni cannot train spell schools; they use the Spellcasting skill alone.
* Demonspawn mutation changes:
  - New facet: malevolent magic. This facet gives a chance to paralyse enemies
      in a radius around the player equal to the mutation rank whenever a spell
      is cast. At the highest rank, this also applies to wands.
  - New facet: corrupting presence. The first two ranks of this facet give a
      chance to corrode, and then malmutate when the player damages a monster.
      The third rank gives an active ability Word of Chaos that blinks away
      every monster in los and may also disable them.
  - The Black Mark facet is revised to a disabling facet, offering a hex
      enhancer at rank 1, followed by black mark at rank 2, then a permanent
      radius 1 silence annulus around the player at rank 3.
  - The Hurl Damnation facet now gives "Demonic Will" at rank 1, providing
      Will+ and dealing damnation damage to monsters that try but fail to hex
      the player, and torment resistance at rank 2.

    shield in the second. The third rank, mana link itself, is unchanged.

  - Later ranks of the spiny facet are now much more impactful.
  - Ignite blood ignites blood at every rank, with power scaling with rank.
  - Demonic Guardian now summons a guardian when the player takes damage. The

    ice mail AC spread over the next two.
  - Most types of scales mutations are now Demonspawn only.

    and are available as random mutations for both demonspawn and other species.
* Poison damage applies much more quickly.
* Strength now gives a simple, linear bonus to damage.

* New good mutation: noise dampening, which halves noise in the players LOS.
* Bone plates, thin skeletal structure, and sturdy frame no longer conflict.

  random mutation in its place.
* Shoutitis and No Potion Heal are reduced to 2 levels from 3.

  higher AC values from any source guaranteeing a certain base amount of

  also been removed.

* Halflings are removed.

Gods
----
* Ashenzari is completely overhauled.
  - At regular intervals, Ashenzari provides the player with a choice of curses
    to apply to their equipment. These grant a skill boost based on the type of
    curse accepted, increase the player's piety, and prevent the player from
    un-equipping the cursed item.
  - At any time, the player can choose to shatter a cursed item, destroying it
    and losing associated piety and skill boosts.
  - Ashenzari grants the following benefits:
    - Scaling with piety: skill boosts from curses, item and monster detection,
      passive mapping.
    - 0* Item identification, portal detection, and exploration trap protection.
    - 2* See Invisible

    to be more expensive as if the player was still at their old XL.

* Makhleb's Major Destruction now fires all bolt-type spells and is stronger.

  - quicksilver ooze, a magic-immune ooze with engulfing and antimagic attacks.
* New Vaults monsters:
  - ironbound frostheart, which freeze enemies that are adjacent to walls.
  - ironbound thunderhulk, which blast distant enemies with lightning from
    above. (They can't hit nearby enemies, however.)

    companions.
* Snake monster changes:
  - New monster: salamander tyrant, a volcano-stoking spellcaster with a
    weakening gaze.

    asphyxiating curare) instead of Force Lance.
  - Naga and naga warriors have increased base damage.
  - Naga warriors cast battlecry.

* Oozes are renamed endoplasms, and cast freeze (but are weaker).

  Dread Liches specialize in demon summoning and paralysis.

* Every other spellcasting monster now uses just a single set of spells.
* Psyche has a new spellbook with Polymorph, Chain of Chaos, Invisibility, and
  Cantrip.
* Air elementals no longer have a tornado, instead gaining Stunning Blast. This
  inflicts 1 turn of paralysis on hit, though rElec makes this less likely.
* Big kobolds are re-named kobold brigands. Kobold brigands always spawn with
  darts, either poison or curare.
* Monsters' melee attack speed is no longer slowed by the weapons they wield.
  Many early-game monsters have had their base damage lowered to compensate.
* Monsters with ranged attacks now have unlimited ammunition. (Except nets.)

---------------------
* Ranged targeters now display accuracy.
* Monster to-hit chance is now shown in xv.
* The in-game macro creation and editing interfaces have been greatly improved:
  - The old interface has now been fully menuized, so editing all happens within
    the menu, and is designed for a smoother process.
  - A new quick-entry menu for macros is available, bound to ctrl-e.
* An in-game menu is available on the F1 key for access to saving, help, and
  macros.
* Form information is shown in the `A` view.

* Wait-to-cast spells (Searing Ray, and the new Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling)

  command as appropriate.
* Spells and potions can be quivered and have informative targeters where
  relevant.
* Other miscellaneous quiver UI improvements:
  - Two new options for controlling the quiver: `fire_order_ability` and
    `fire_order_spell`. These give you full control over non-items when cycling
    the quiver.
  - Berserk is now excluded from the fire order by default, and won't autoquiver
    on Berserker starts.
  - Changing a quivered item's letter will not remove it from the quiver.
  - Improvements to inscriptions: @Qn inscriptions on items are supported at
    the Q menu. Behaviour of !Q, =f, and =F has been improved.
* Portal and zot alerts are now included by default in `runrest_stop`, and zot
  clock alerts force-interrupt all delays.
* The "allow_extended_colours" console option now defaults to true, since
  modern terminals uniformly support more than 8 terminal colors.

  size be constrained by an x:y ratio, providing better defaults for ultra-wide
  monitors.

Items
-----

    still possible on randarts, or in certain vaults.)

    which apply a random effect to a random visible enemy when evoked. They
    recharge with XP.
  - Wands of disintegrate are renamed to wands of mindburst. They no longer
    affect mindless creatures.
  - Wands of enslavement are now called wands of charming.
* Equipment is identified once the player is in reach, without needing to be
  worn.
* All sources of regeneration now heal 1 HP per normal turn (formerly 0.4).
  - Trolls now have slightly more inherent regen and slightly less AC.
  - Vine Stalkers gain their full innate regeneration earlier.
* The spectral brand has been redesigned. It now triggers on every attack,
  creating a spectral copy of the weapon which makes an additional attack (if

  copy vanishes once the player does anything other than attack. This effect no
  longer depends on Evocations skill.
* Shields slow melee attacks much more at low Shields skill levels.

  the player into a raging, lightning-filled tempest:

    increases with spellpower.

  spirit of the caster's armour to fight alongside them. The heavier the

  random foes in sight with the attacker's wielded weapon. Spellpower increases
  the number of foes that can be struck with one cast.

  Coupling, a level 8 Air spell. When cast, the player must wait in place for
  a random number of turns (reduced by spellpower) until the capacitor

* Chain Lighting has been redesigned. It is now level 9 and is dramatically
  more powerful, arcing between visible foes for massive damage that partially
  ignores AC and rElec.

  the ego spawns a spectral weapon to fight along side the user whose strength
  scales with Evocations skill.

    effect.

    evocations skill) when a spell is refunded.
  - The cloak of the Thief is changed from +Fog to *Fog, creating fog when the
    player is hit.

  affected 3 times by AC.

  - Song of Slaying is now Transmutations and renamed Wereblood; the noise is
    reduced somewhat.

  to stand on the corpse.
* Frozen Ramparts has its effect end upon player movement.
* Death Channel spectral things have a shorter duration and fade if Death
  Channel expires.

  Horns and Talons (octopodes keep their tentacle spike) instead of randomly
  choosing.
* Irradiate now checks monster AC but does slightly more damage.

Gods
----
* Gozag no longer gives a free potion petition on worship.
* Nemelex's deck gifting begins at higher piety.
* Nemelex' Shaft card is removed, and the Exile card no longer has a chance
  to self banish.

Interface
---------
* The "quiver" feature is generalized and can now hold spells, evokables, and
  abilities. The `f`ire interface can be used to target any quiverable
  action, and quiverable actions can be autofired via shift+tab/`p`. Existing
  autofight ranged settings such as autofight_throw are generalized to handle
  new quiverables. The `]` key swaps between the two most recent quivered
  actions. See the options guide for more information on new and updated
  options: autofight_throw, autofight_stop, automagic_stop,
  fail_severity_to_quiver, launcher_autoquiver, fire_order. See the manual
  section 4, subsection "Attacking and firing" for a summary of the relevant
  key bindings.
* Launchers can now be fired independently of the quiver; use `v` to target
  (like reaching weapons) or regular autofight commands to autotarget.
* Static targeters are added for spells and abilities that indicate which cells
  will be affected, along with a new option to configure which of these are
  shown while casting, force_targeter.
* Player wand damage, spell damage, and spell accuracy is now displayed in the
  UI.
* Viewing a monster with `xv` now shows to-hit chance with your current weapon.
* Monsters' spell damage is shown in `xv`.
* Examining cells with multiple interesting things now gives a selection menu.
* The "view stack/pickup key" `;` can be pressed twice to force autopickup even
  in unsafe situations.
* The `^x` view description is now available from all targeting prompts, and
  when used while targeting lists valid targets in range.
* Any floor can be annotated from anywhere in the `!` interface.
* Spellpower is now displayed as a percentage of max spellpower.
* Macro updates: Macros/keybinds can be viewed via the `~` menu in-game. RC file
  keybind settings support escape codes.
* Updated uption: travel_open_doors now has a setting that tries to avoid
  opening doors during autotravel.
* New option: travel_one_unsafe_move. Setting this option to true causes
  auto-travel to make one move towards its goal before conducting the usual
  safety checks.
* New option: monster_item_view_features. This is a regex list option, features
  that match patterns on this list will be displayed in the `^x` view
  description.
* New option: always_show_zot. When enabled, the remaining time until Zot finds
  the player is always shown, rather than when there are only 1000 turns left.
* New options: tile_overlay_col and tile_overlay_alpha_percent control the
  appearance of the message window in local tiles.

Lua
---
* Three new hooks, chk_ability_choice, chk_spell_choice, and c_message can be
  used to answer the ability and spell menu prompts and to react to messages.
* A new api is introduced for targeted fire of spells, items, and abilities as
  a less brittle alternative to sending keys. See lua functions:
  crawl.do_targeted_command, spells.cast, item.fire, you.activate_ability,
  you.quiver_valid, and you.quiver_enabled.
* Other new functions: you.memorise (memorise a spell by name),
  spells.power_perc (get spellpower for a spell as a percentage)

    Instead, the player is either teleported to monsters, banished, or set upon
    by Abyss summons.
  - Cheibriados' wrath no longer uses miscasts. At very high tension, in
    addition to sleeping and slowing the player, Chei makes a lot of noise. At
    low tension, miscasts are replaced by stat damage.

    choice of corrosive bolt, primal wave, or thorn volley.

* New Potion of Stabbing that gives a 50% chance to upgrade weak stabs (e.g.
  distracted monsters) to strong ones (e.g. sleeping monsters).
* Tin of Tremorstones, a new multiuse evocable. Tremorstones have 3 charges
  which recover over time with XP. When used, it creates a number of radius 2
  explosions (the number scales with evocations skill) near the center
  of present monster that are triple-affected by AC (like LRD). The explosions
  are randomly skewed and may hit the user. Most useful for players with good
  armour.

  effects, and its cloning effect can create friendly and neutral monsters.

  class. Now all such weapons are described as 'vorpal'.
* Unrandart changes:
  - New unrand: Cigotuvi's Embrace, a +4 leather armour with rN+, rRot and
    *Drain that automatically gathers corpses to increase AC. The AC decays
    slowly over time but decays more quickly as more corpses are added.
  - Boots of the Assassin are now called the hood of the Assassin and use the
    headgear slot.

    with enhancement applying independently for each school.

    immunity to monsters wielding it.
  - The Dragonskin Cloak now provides rCorr instead of sticky flame
    resistance.
  - The scythe of Curses no longer curses items in inventory, and now applies
    death curses instead of necromancy miscasts.
  - The plutonium sword still applies transmutations miscasts, but gains a
    chance to polymorph the target on hit (since this is no longer a miscast
    effect for monsters).
  - The brooch of Shielding is now a guardian spirit amulet with SH+8.
  - Bloodbane has been removed, having been merged into Leech.
  - Maxwell's Etheric Cage has been removed.
* Phial of floods now applies a silencing "waterlogged" debuff to all monsters
  in the flooded area and no longer summons water elementals.
* Staves of poison now do resistible poison damage on hit like other staves
  instead of just having a chance to poison.
* Distortion branded weapons no longer teleport foes.
* Distortion unwield effects no longer cause a translocations miscast. Instead,
  they either teleport the player to monsters, banish the player, or cause
  severe contamination.
* Regeneration items only activate after attuning to the player at full HP,
  identical to the amulet.
* Scarf egos are revised: cloud immunity and spirit shield are removed, harm
  and invisibility are added. Harm scarves do not drain the player when
  removed.
* Amulets of reflection now always give +5 SH and must attune to the player at
  full HP. Reflected missiles, poison, and banishments now correctly award
  piety.
* Cloak egos are revised: invisibility is removed, preservation (providing
  corrosion resistance) and stealth are added.
* The Harm property can now appear on randart armour, and does not incur a
  drain penalty on removal.
* Stat rings are now always either +6 or -4. AC, EV, and Slay rings are now
  always either +4 or -4.
* Removed: potion of agility, staff of power, crystal ball of energy, sack of
  spiders, lamp of fire, fan of gales, wand of scattershot, amulets of the
  gourmand, amulets of harm, amulets of rage.

  select servers.

  than that many chunks in inventory. Its default value is 10 for non-ghoul
  characters.

* The behavior of `tile_filter_scaling=false` has been improved to work on all
  tiles in the game, for better pixelated effects.
* Webtiles now supports showing save info in the lobby; see CAO for this feature
  in action.

Monsters
--------

  just before and in Lair. She has a steam, acid, or swamp dragon scales, Bolt
  of Fire, and Mesmerize. Only one of Maggie or Margery will place in a game.

  the scroll.

Spells
------
* Spell in many schools have been redesigned to make the schools have better
  differentiation, more positional considerations, and better UI. The
  descriptions below describe the schools' individual focus and any new,
  changed, and removed spells in each school:
  - Fire spells have directed explosions or set things on fire:
    + New L1 Conjurations/Fire spell Foxfire that conjures two foxfire
      projectiles that quickly hone in on their target, each doing a bit more
      than half the damage of Flame Tongue.
    + Conjure Flame now creates embers on the player's position that turn into
      a flame cloud a turn later. The embers smother if a monster steps on them.
    + Inner Flame now creates a flame cloud under the affected monster
      whenever it takes damage in addition to the usual explosion it makes
      when the monster dies.
    + New L6 Conjurations/Fire spell Starburst that fires 8 range 5 bolts in
      the principle directions.
    + Removed spells: Flame Tongue, Throw Flame, Bolt of Fire.
  - Air school spells bounce, are pointy, or are hard to direct:
    + Airstrike damage now scales so it's greater the more unoccupied squares
      there are surrounding the target.
    + Summon Lightning Spire now places the spire randomly.
  - Earth spells are directed:
    + Borgnjor's Vile Clutch now is a range 6 always-penetrating beam instead
      of a smite-targeted 3x3 explosion.
  - Ice spells are diffuse and subtle:
    + New L3 Ice spell Frozen Ramparts that makes all walls within radius 2
      become covered in ice, damaging monsters that walk by. Damage bypasses AC
      and slows cold-blooded animals.
    + New L4 Conjurations/Ice spell Hailstorm that fires a ring of ice beams
      from radius 2 to radius 3, not affecting radius 1 squares. Monsters with
      rC+++ such as ice beasts are immune to this effect.
    + Ozocubu's Refrigeration does 33% more damage on-average and no longer
      harms the caster.
    + New L9 Ice spell Absolute Zero that instantly freezes to death the
      closest monster in range, leaving an ice block. A random closest monster
      is chosen as the target when there are ties. The spell is range 5 and
      very loud, with noise attenuated by power.
    + Removed spells: Throw Frost, Throw Icicle, Bolt of Cold, Glaciate.
    + As a result of these changes, Ice Elementalists no longer put starting
      skill in Conjurations.
  - Conjurations are pure magic with good accuracy in some way:
    + Iskenderun's mystic blast now makes a range 5 explosion around the
      player that damages and pushes back monsters, potentially colliding them
      with features and other monsters.
    + Dazzling Flash replaces Dazzling Spray. Makes a flash centered on the
      player of up to radius 3 that can blind monsters in the affected area.
    + Searing Ray now fires all its rays at the chosen target, adjusting
      the rays as the target moves. If no target is chosen, the spell
      repeatedly fires in the chosen direction. The rays all penetrate and
      each has the same damage and to-hit. The ray damage is adjusted to have
      the same overall damage distribution as before this change.
    + Spellforged Servitor now gives only one spell to the servitor. This is
      the highest level servitor-compatible spell the player has from the
      following sets, in order of preference: L4 and higher ranged damage
      spells, cloud spells, and low-level or short-range spells.
    + Force Lance is removed.
  - Poison spells poison things or perform some kind of alchemy
    + Sting is now a range 3 Poison/Transmutations spell using the same
      partly-resistible beam type previously used by Poison Arrow.
    + New L6 Poison/Transmutations spell Eringya's Noxious Bog that creates a
      temporary toxic bog trail as the player moves. The bog terrain applies
      the same partly-resistible damage flavor as Sting as well as the
      movement and combat penalties of shallow water.
    + Removed spells: Venom Bolt, Poison Arrow
    + As a result of these changes, Venom Mages now put starting skill in
      Transmutations instead of Conjurations.
  - Necromancy has balance adjustments to make the school not so strong and
    to begin to move it closer to a melee support school:
    + Corpse Rot now creates miasma clouds in a ring around the player, making
      one cloud for each corpse in LOS, but with lower duration.
    + Agony and Dispel Undead are now range 1, and Dispel Undead is now L4.
    + Regeneration and Bolt of Draining are removed.
* The Young Poisoner's Handbook now contains Ignite Poison.
* Confusing Touch is now level 3 and checks MR instead of monster hit dice.
* The player is now immune to the melee-fumbling effects of liquefied ground
  made by casting Leda's Liquefaction. The slow movement applies regardless of
  flight status and the spell can be used while flying.
* Firestorm and Ignition now can burn trees, and Fireball burns trees in all
  squares of its explosion.
* Call Imp no longer bases the type of imp summoned on spellpower.
* The Confuse spell has been removed.
* Spell miscast effects have been simplified to give contamination and a single
  per-school effect, scaling with spell risk and level. The new effects by
  school are:
  - Charms and Hexes: debuff and slow.
  - Summoning: durably summon a nameless horror (new monster).
  - Translocation: dimension anchor.
  - Transmutation: extra contamination for the player, malmutate a monster.
  - Conjuration: irresistible AC-ignoring damage.
  - Elemental schools: school flavored damage (Earth uses fragmentation
    damage).
* The Deflect Missiles spell has been removed.
* Tukima's Dance can no longer be used if the player sacrificed Love.
* Lesser Beckoning and Teleport Other now turn allies hostile.
* Eldritch Tentacles from malign gateway can no longer attack out of LOS of the
  player, and arrive sooner after the gateway is opened.

Branches, Environment
---------------------
* Incremental pregeneration:
  - This mode generates the dungeon in a stable order for all games regardless
    of the path taken by the player, meaning that the behaviour of seeds for
    online and offline games should now be the same.
  - Games using the same seed will see the same dungeon if they are
    incrementally pregenerated without requiring the long initial generation
    time of full pregeneration as introduced in 0.23.

  - Bloodless: No regeneration with monsters in sight, -20% HP, stealth bonus,
    undead resistances, batform, no other transformations or berserk.
  - Blood states are transitioned by an ability which costs delay; becoming
    bloodless incurs no penalty, becoming alive causes a temporary frail
    mutation.
  - Bat form causes stat drain.

Gods
----
* Fedhas reimagined:
  - Piety is gained exclusively from kills instead of through corpse decay.
  - Fedhas abilities now create plant allies directly as temporary summons
    instead of creating permanent allies using plants. All abilities cost
    piety instead of food.
  - New abilities:
    * 2*: Active 'Wall of Briars' ability to surround the player with briar
          patches. Hostile monsters will attack briars to reach you, taking
          damage.
    * 3*: Active 'Grow Ballistomycete' ability to place a ballistomycete at
          any location within radius 2. The ballistomycete will fire spores

          additionally confuses living creatures.
    * 4*: Active 'Overgrow' ability to destroy any non-permarock walls in a
          3x3 area, replacing them with plant allies, mostly wandering
          mushrooms or burning bushes and sometimes ballistomycetes or oklob
          plants.
    * 5*: Active 'Grow Oklob' ability to place an oklob plant at any location
          within radius 2.

    Invocations skill of 1.5 times the spell-power received from equivalent
    levels of training in the spell's schools.
  - The Divine Energy ability and Sif's miscast protection are removed.
* Trog and Okawaru now can gift unbranded boomerangs and javelins.

  - The game seed is saved correctly and will no longer show as 0 for games
    started after this fix.
  - Seed stability for floating point calculations: for most configuration the
    main dungeon should remain unchanged, but 32 bit systems (and 32-bit builds)
    should now be much more stable, among others. Slime will likely differ.

    of some layouts, leading to divergent seeds.

Stone Soup 0.23 (20190207)
--------------------------

Highlights
----------
* Trap system overhaul
* New Gauntlet portal to replace Labyrinths
* Nemelex Xobeh rework
* Nine unrandarts reworked and the new "Rift" unrandart added
* Support for seeded dungeon play

Branches, Environment
---------------------
* Trap system overhaul:
  - Traps that generate on the ground are always revealed.
  - Exploration has a chance to trigger a "trap effect" independent from
    terrain traps. The possible effects are alarm, shaft, and teleport near
    monsters.
  - Monsters only trigger traps in sight of the player.
  - Alarm traps now always Mark the player whenever they are triggered in LOS.
  - Net traps now try to net the player whenever they are triggered in LOS.
  - New trap: dispersal trap. When triggered, every actor in sight of the trap
    is blinked.
  - Trap placement in Ossuaries, Zot:5, and Tomb has been overhauled. In Zot:5
    and Tomb, all mechanical traps save for net traps have been removed.
  - Grate traps (triggered by pressure plates) have been removed.
* New Gauntlet portal to replace Labyrinths:
  - Gauntlets have the player choose a path through several combat arenas,
    each of which contains (sometimes exotic) monsters and loot.
  - Access to each arena is one-way using transporters. Teleports and Passage
    of Golubria are disabled.
  - All paths lead to a minotaur who guards a pile of treasure and the exit.
  - Gauntlets are found where Labyrinths previously generated.
* Support for seeded play:
  - A new option for pregenerating the entire connected dungeon based on a fixed
    seed has been added. This takes a bit of time, but ensures that any
    playthroughs of a particular seed will use the same dungeon.
  - This option is not yet available for online play, but can be used offline.
    See the manual section "Seeded play" for details.
  - The dungeon RNG has been separated from the gameplay RNG to allow this
    feature to work.
  - Each game seed generates a unique dungeon (including layout and
    monster and item placement) that is always the same for the same version
    of crawl, as long as levels are generated in the same order.
  - If you see that two games with the same seed generate a different dungeon,
    please report this as a bug!
* New vaults: early thematic item shops and monsters guarding manuals, as well
  as new ghost vaults for many branches.
* Translucent doors that can be seen through when closed have been added.
  These are used in most runed door vaults and in some Elf layouts.

  - Decks are are accessed through abilities and no longer exist as items.
  - Nemelex offers three abilities: "Draw Escape", "Draw Destruction", and
    "Draw Summoning", which provide card effects.
  - The deck abilities do not have rarities; card power levels are determined
    by invocations and piety alone.
  - Nemelex periodically adds cards to the three abstract decks.
  - Triple Draw works on the three decks as before, offering a choice of three
    cards. The piety cost is increased.
  - Deal Four deals four cards from a deck and has a reduced piety cost.
  - Stack Five constructs a player-ordered stack of five cards drawn from any
    of the three decks to be drawn later. Creating a new stack discards the
    old. The piety cost is the same as old stack five.
  - The Velocity card no longer hastes enemies, instead always slowing them
    with a chance proportional to power.
  - The Storm card has been revised. It now performs a wind blast followed by
    one to nine electrical explosions.
* Elyvilon's Heal Other's is adjusted:
  - The formula depends only on monster type, not specific monster maxhp.
  - Player Ghosts and Pandemonium Lords are now immune.

  using the same scale as melee damage.

  - Gozag displays bribe information.
  - Hepliaklqana displays ancestor upgrades.
  - Nemelex Xobeh displays deck information.
  - Wu Jian displays information about martial attacks.
* The Hepliakqana ancestor reaching full health interrupts resting. The exact
  behaviour of this interrupt can be configured by rest_wait_ancestor.
* The new display_chars cloud_weak, cloud_fading, and cloud_terminal indicate
  remaining cloud duration in console.
* WebTiles users can use a "Forgot Password" link to reset their password
  via a link sent to their registration email address. This feature is not yet
  enabled on most official servers.

  - The Sceptre of Torment is now a +7 eveningstar of pain, and its torment
    does not affect the wielder.

    spellpower. The weapon's enchantment is now +8.
  - Finisher gains a chance to instant-explode the target and loses Str+3.

    storm clouds in place of its old mist.
  - The Skin of Zhor gains a passive Metabolic Englaciation effect and SInv.
  - The Storm Bow no longer occasionally creates rain clouds.
  - Unrandarts with melee effects that could anger nearby allies give a proper
    warning.
* Wand charges for wands of digging, enslavement, flame, paralysis, polymorph,
  and random effects have been reduced.
* Butchering a corpse always leaves a skeleton.
* The blowgun targeter now displays the chance to affect the target.

      two tiles in the opposite direction and attacking any adjacent enemies.

  caster's HP. Fedhas now permits its use.

  several simulacra from it.

  has more of an impact, attack delay is more predictable, and Throwing
  should be more viable as a ranged option as compared to bows and crossbows,
  among other changes.

    renamed to 'hunting sling', and a new, rare 'greatsling' has been added.

    and a new, rare 'triple crossbow' type has been added.

  giving both +accuracy & +damage. Scrolls of enchant weapon I, II, and III
  have all been merged into a new "enchant weapon" scroll. The scrolls are
  rarer, but always succeed.
* Shields have been rebalanced. All non-shield-enchantment sources of SH have
  been halved, and the effectiveness of SH at blocking attacks has been
  doubled, to make the utility of a point of SH roughly equivalent to a point
  of EV. In effect, this is a small buff. Non-bucklers can now be enchanted
  past +3.
* Multiple changes to unrandarts:
  - The blowgun of the Assassin returns; it has a chance to affect the target
    more than normal blowguns.
  - New unrand: the +8 orange crystal plate armour {Archmagi, Int+3 Clar
    SustAb}.

    their movement, and the scimitar of Flaming Death now sometimes applies
    sticky flame to its victims.

    and EV.
  - Skullcrusher is now +3 with +7 strength.
  - The Trident of the Octopus King now starts at +8 and gets an additional +
    for each Ring of the Octopus King worn. If anyone reads this & gets it to
    +10 or higher in an actual game, send screenshots!
  - Punk is now a +7 greatsling {Freeze, rC+}.
  - Sniper is now a "heavy crossbow", a triple crossbow with 27 base delay.

  - Many other weapon artefacts have had their enchantments tweaked.

    have had their enchantment levels adjusted.

    abilities.

    type.
  - Brown (contaminated) chunks are gone, replaced with normal ones.

  on the player.

  creatures in LOS.

  reduce transformation durations to one turn, rather than cancelling them
  immediately.
* Identify scrolls now always identify a single item.
* Jewellery automatically identifies once equipped.
* Amulets of inaccuracy are always cursed.
* New rings of stealth and loudness, which positively/negatively adjust
  a player's stealth.
* Amulets of rage no longer have a tiny chance of extending berserk duration.

  them randomly around the area.

  walls.

  Temple or on D:2-9.
  - Piety on kills.
  - All followers are immune from their own clouds.
  - 1*: Storm Shield: you passively generate elemental clouds around you and

      shields, in addition to strong natural digging abilities and a permanent
      stasis effect.
    - Vine stalkers regenerate quickly, but cannot heal with wands or

  other monsters and attack their target in a single turn.

  healing when enemies are in sight (half and no healing for those levels
  respectively). Stat regeneration and the third level of the mutation
  are unchanged.
* Fast/slow movement mutations no longer occur randomly.

      brethren satyrs, who can empower their nearby allies.
    - Wind drakes, who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and airstrike the
      player.
    - Thorn lotuses, plants adrift on the water that pepper the player with
      thorns fired from afar.
    - Thorn hunters, who fire volleys of thorns and create briar patches to
      impede their foes' movements.
    - Dryads, who turn the forest against you by casting Awaken Forest like
      spriggan druids and summoning snaplasher vines that pull their enemies
      around.

      and strike down the player with said water.

    - Mana vipers, snakes with an antimagic bite;
    - Naga sharpshooters, who snipe at the player with Portal Projectile;
    - Naga ritualists, who can amplify poison in enemies and also cast
      Olgreb's Toxic Radiance;

      version of Ignite Poison, and Iskenderun's Mystic Blast;
    - Salamander firebrands, whose attacks cause a ring of flames to appear
      around the target.
    - Octopode crushers, who can throw both the victims they constrict as well
      as icicles.
* A new set of enemies based on demonspawn, appearing in Pan.
    - Base types:
        - monstrous (auxiliary attacks and more HP);
        - gelid (rC++ and icemail - bonus AC which dissipates on fire damage);
        - infernal (rF++ and fire attacks);
        - putrid (rPois, gains HP on nearby kills);
        - torturous (augmentation, powered by pain, and spines).
      - Classes:
        - blood saint (Legendary Destruction, which casts random powerful
          conjurations, and Ephemeral Infusion, which temporarily heals
          nearby allies);
        - chaos champions (Chaotic Reflection, which inflicts a random hex-like
          effect on itself and the target, and Random Bolt as per the rod
          of destruction);
        - warmongers (Grand Avatar, essentially a hybrid battlesphere and
          spectral weapon which triggers on sufficiently damaging attacks of
          nearby allies, and Sap Magic, a hex which hinders spellcasting success
          progressively as spells are cast);
        - corrupters (Plane Rend, which summons high tier enemies from other
          branches, and Corrupt Body, which inflicts a small set of temporary
          mutations);
        - black suns (Black Mark, which empowers nearby allies with various
          draining attacks that heal on hit, and previously existing spells
          Bolt of Draining, Malign Offering, and Dispel Undead).
* Adjustments to lair branch enemies:
    - Spriggan druids' Druid's Call now calls 2-3 creatures out of LOS nearby
      and does not invisibly might creatures; instead, nearby creatures
      are healed and frenzied on their death. Stone Arrow also replaces
      Sunray in their spell set.
    - Siren songs' pulling effects are now irresistible if the player is
      already mesmerised.
    - Siren songs call drowned souls, weak temporary enemies with a drowning
      attack.
    - Manticores' spines now embed themselves in targets, causing damage while
      moving until a few turns is spent doing nothing to remove them.
    - Harpies no longer steal food or eat food off of the ground.
    - Plain salamanders have been weakened, and all salamanders can slither
      around on land.
* Adjustments to other enemies:
    - Quokkas are speed 12 (making them effectively identical to grey rats).
    - Boggarts are more durable.
    - Rakshasas gain a monster spell "Phantom Mirror", which summons
      a clone of a nearby allied monster with half the hit points, with
      a 50% chance of swapping the clone for the original; this replaces
      their previous self-cloning abilities. They can now also cast
      Iskenderun's Mystic Blast and will summon two clones of themselves
      at 50% HP as a one-time effect.
    - Giant orange brains get Mass Confusion instead of Confusion.
    - Spriggans in general now merely have fast movement speed instead of
      fast speed in general, more damage and less EV.
    - Spriggan air mages have Haste (replacing Shock).
    - Deep elf demonologists summon more greater demons instead of minor
      demons.
    - Draconian knights have fewer but distinct spell sets focusing on
      ice and necromancy.
    - Gargoyles and molten gargoyles now have Stone Arrow and Bolt of
      Magma respectively, and generate with mace-type weapons.
    - Metal gargoyles are now war gargoyles - fast and with the ability to
      fire metal fragments at targets.

      capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm
      undead and occasionally summon spectral things.

    - The fan of air elementals is now the fan of gales, and blows back
      nearby enemies.

      rubble to fall from nearby rock, stone, or permarock walls to damage
      creatures adjacent to them, and has a chance to shaft creatures;
    - A new elemental evoker item - the phial of floods; it generates a wave
      of water which temporarily leaves a pool of water behind, and summons
      water elementals.

    - When successful, generates a chimera; a new monster with three heads.
      Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which provides
      better/stronger beasts at higher Evocations skill. The heads determine
      the attacks and abilities available to the monster.
* New "sack of spiders" item:
    - Fixed charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
    - On evoking, creates webs around you and releases spiders.
    - Number of webs and type/number of spiders scales with evocations.

  inventory.
* The rod of striking now functions as a melee weapon - it expends charges
  to deal additional damage in melee.
* Boots of running have a -1 movement delay (was -2).
* The lantern of shadows' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations,
  and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.
* New unrand: the +4 moon troll leather armour {Spirit MP+5 Regen}.
* Adjustments to unrands:
   - Arga is now a broad axe.

Branches, environment
---------------------
* The Hall of Blades layout has been adjusted, and now contains two weapons
  with "interesting brands" instead of just one.
* The Abyss is revamped yet again. It now contains five (still infinite)
  levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with
  different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The rune
  appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper levels.
* The Abyssal rune always appears in a vault, never lying around on the floor.
* Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss exits.
* Many Ziggurat floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few monster
  sets have been replaced entirely.
* Three new Sprint maps: "Thunderdome" by evilmike, "The Pits" and "Arena of
  Blood" both by st.
* The Abyss no longer exists in Sprint.
* New layouts for Cocytus, Gehenna, Snake, and the main Dungeon.
* More layouts allowed in Zot.
* New Lair branch ending vaults, and many other new vaults.

  time.

Character
---------

* Black draconians gain permanent flight (like Tengu but without the speed
  boost) at XL 14.
* Removed the hidden special cost of Spellcasting, Stealth, Evocations and
  Invocations. Aptitudes adjusted.

  coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or less
  experience to gain levels than before.

* Hill Orcs are better at Axes, worse at gaining levels.
* Tengu are better at gaining levels.

      more masses become visible.
    - Apocalypse crab: breathes clouds of chaos.
    - Thrashing horror: moves like a bat, tramples, and frenzies.
    - Spatial maelstrom: incorporeal vortex that turns walls into spatial
      vortices.
* New deep troll specialist monsters, appearing in late-D deep troll packs:
    - Deep troll shamans: cast Might Other and Haste Other on their
      accompanying deep troll packs.
    - Deep troll earth mages: cast Dig and LRD to allow the rest of the deep
      troll pack to pursue their opponent.
* New vaults monsters:
    - Vault sentinels, with a signal horn that generates a lot of noise and
      the Sentinel's Mark spell which alerts all creatures on the level to
      the player's location.
    - Vault wardens, with the ability to close and seal doors near the player
      for a time or until they are killed.

      projectile that can knock monsters backwards.

      bolts that can blind creatures.
    - Iskenderun's Battlesphere (level 4 Conjuration/Charms). Creates an
      autonomous globe that shoots at enemies in sync with your conjurations.

  damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is reduced
  to compensate.

  a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1 damage/accuracy
  boost to replace spiked flails.

  the player will turn them into a random form (including several new forms -
  tree form, wisp form, porcupine form and fungus form).

  summons a few level-appropriate monsters.

  Trog).

  Robe of Folly, plutonium sword.

  default.
* List options can be prepended to with ^=.

  "forbidden".
