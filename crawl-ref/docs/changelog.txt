  - always get the full effect of all mutations.
* Some Demonspawn mutations have been modified:

    cloud immunity earlier and separately.
* The hoof mutation no longer gives extra damage or a stealth penalty for
  players wearing boots.
* Player rPois now gives a consistent 2/3rds resistance to poison effects; this
  is lower than the previous resistance to poisoning, but higher than the old

  through rPois, and paralytic stings (wasps) can now slow through rPois.

Monsters
--------
* Many enemy glyphs have been adjusted. See 0.14_monster_glyphs.txt.
* Monsters will no longer pick up items that the player has seen. Allies won't
  pick up items at all.
* Corrosion affects all of your equipment, but only temporarily, and the chance
  to corrode equipment does not consider item enchantment.
* Draining effects no longer permanently reduce monsters' stats ('hit dice');
  instead, they apply a temporary status which reduces hit dice for the
  duration.
* Monsters no longer fall asleep after long periods of time.
* New monster: ghost crabs, found in Crypt. They breathe ghostly flames that
  call dangerous specters into existence.

* Undead and nonliving enemies regenerate as fast as other enemies.
* Silver statues and orange crystal statues are immune to disintegration,
  but have less health and AC and have their abilities converted to spells

  invisibly.
* Curse skulls are now immobile, again.
* Lost souls now make enemies into ghosts instead of specters.

  plague shamblers, giant slugs, elephant slugs, giant fireflies, brown oozes,
  pulsating lumps, big fish, sharks, lava worms.

Spells
------

  for several turns instead of destroying potions.

  entirely when it successfully confuses an enemy. While it's in effect, your
  attacks do no damage. It's been moved to level 2.

  caster's HP. Fedhas now permits its use.
* Simulacrum now works on a single corpse at the caster's feet, creating
  several simulacra from it.
* Monsters casting Simulacrum now affect all corpses in LOS, producing half as
  many simulacra as the player version of the spell.
* Many spells, which used player skill, now use spellpower instead: Death's
  Door, Passwall, Sticks to Snakes, Ozocubu's Armour, Condensation Shield,
  Stoneskin, Statue Form, and Ice Form.

Items
-----
* Item destruction is no more.
* Ranged combat has been rewritten based on melee attacks - AC and EV
  has more of an impact, attack delay is more predictable, and Throwing
  should be more viable as a ranged option as compared to bows and crossbows,
  among other changes.
  - Slings have been split into two weapon types; the basic type has been
    renamed to 'hunting sling', and a new, rare 'greatsling' has been added.

    and a new, rare 'triple crossbow' type has been added.

* Weapon enchantment & slaying bonuses have been merged into a single number,
  giving both +accuracy & +damage. Scrolls of enchant weapon I, II, and III
  have all been merged into a new "enchant weapon" scroll. The scrolls are
  rarer, but always succeed.
* Shields have been rebalanced. All non-shield-enchantment sources of SH have
  been halved, and the effectiveness of SH at blocking attacks has been
  doubled, to make the utility of a point of SH roughly equivalent to a point
  of EV. In effect, this is a small buff. Non-bucklers can now be enchanted
  past +3.
* Multiple changes to unrandarts:
  - The blowgun of the Assassin returns; it has a chance to affect the target
    more than normal blowguns.
  - New unrand: the +8 orange crystal plate armour {Archmagi, Int+3 Clar
    SustAb}.
  - New unrand: the +6 Majin-Bo {vamp, Archmagi, MP+6 Int+6}. A quarterstaff
    that takes HP every time you cast a spell.

    their movement, and the scimitar of Flaming Death now sometimes applies
    sticky flame to its victims.
  - Leech is now +8, with -2 to all stats (instead of -1), and -2 to both AC
    and EV.
  - Skullcrusher is now +3 with +7 strength.
  - The Trident of the Octopus King now starts at +8 and gets an additional +
    for each Ring of the Octopus King worn. If anyone reads this & gets it to
    +10 or higher in an actual game, send screenshots!
  - Punk is now a +7 greatsling {Freeze, rC+}.
  - Sniper is now a "heavy crossbow", a triple crossbow with 27 base delay.
  - The Mace of Brilliance is now the +1 Eveningstar "Brilliance".
  - Many other weapon artefacts have had their enchantments tweaked.
  - Maxwell's Patent Armour now gives rF+ rC+ instead of Conservation.

    have had their enchantment levels adjusted.

  - Branded non-artefact weapons can now be given a temporary re-brand.
  - Damage from the electrocution brand has been reduced slightly.

    temporarily drained whenever it does fire.

    abilities.

  - All types of fruit have been merged together into one gooey, messy item
    type.
  - Brown (contaminated) chunks are gone, replaced with normal ones.
  - Cheese, sausages, and ambrosia are no more.
* New item: potion of cancellation, which removes enchantments & contamination
  on the player.
* Scrolls of vulnerability have been simplified; they now just halve MR for all
  creatures in LOS.
* Cancellation-type effects (from the potion, quicksilver dragons, etc) now
  reduce transformation durations to one turn, rather than cancelling them
  immediately.
* Identify scrolls now always identify a single item.
* Jewellery automatically identifies once equipped.
* Amulets of inaccuracy are always cursed.
* New rings of stealth and loudness, which positively/negatively adjust
  a player's stealth.
* Amulets of rage no longer have a tiny chance of extending berserk duration.
* Sacks of spiders now place webs directly onto enemies, rather than spreading
  them randomly around the area.
* Cleaving hits the full eight squares around a player, when not blocked by
  walls.

    speeding up the player.

  Temple or on D:2-9.
  - Piety on kills.
  - All followers are immune from their own clouds.

        noise.
  - 2*: Upheaval: blast a small nearby area with elemental forces.

---------

    - Formicids possess four strong arms to use large weapons together with
      shields, in addition to strong natural digging abilities and a permanent
      stasis effect.
    - Vine stalkers regenerate quickly, but cannot heal with wands or
      potions; they possess innate spirit shield and an anti-magic bite.
* Felids have an innate jump attack ability, allowing them to jump over
  other monsters and attack their target in a single turn.

  "black mark," which gives melee attacks a chance to heal the player and apply
  a bad status to the victim.

  healing when enemies are in sight (half and no healing for those levels
  respectively). Stat regeneration and the third level of the mutation
  are unchanged.
* Fast/slow movement mutations no longer occur randomly.
* Recommended backgrounds and species have been adjusted; in particular,

  equipment.
* Abominations don't heal naturally; those created from spells can heal
  by melding further with crawling corpses and macabre masses.
* New enemies:
    - Fauns, who hex the player before attacking from afar, and their larger
      brethren satyrs, who can empower their nearby allies.
    - Wind drakes, who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and airstrike the
      player.
    - Thorn lotuses, plants adrift on the water that pepper the player with
      thorns fired from afar.
    - Thorn hunters, who fire volleys of thorns and create briar patches to
      impede their foes' movements.
    - Dryads, who turn the forest against you by casting Awaken Forest like
      spriggan druids and summoning snaplasher vines that pull their enemies
      around.

      and strike down the player with said water.

    - Mana vipers, snakes with an antimagic bite;
    - Naga sharpshooters, who snipe at the player with Portal Projectile;
    - Naga ritualists, who can amplify poison in enemies and also cast
      Olgreb's Toxic Radiance;
    - Salamander mystics, with Bolt of Magma, Haste Other, a single-target
      version of Ignite Poison, and Iskenderun's Mystic Blast;
    - Salamander firebrands, whose attacks cause a ring of flames to appear
      around the target.
    - Octopode crushers, who can throw both the victims they constrict as well
      as icicles.
* A new set of enemies based on demonspawn, appearing in Pan.
    - Base types:
        - monstrous (auxiliary attacks and more HP);
        - gelid (rC++ and icemail - bonus AC which dissipates on fire damage);
        - infernal (rF++ and fire attacks);
        - putrid (rPois, gains HP on nearby kills);
        - torturous (augmentation, powered by pain, and spines).
      - Classes:
        - blood saint (Legendary Destruction, which casts random powerful
          conjurations, and Ephemeral Infusion, which temporarily heals
          nearby allies);
        - chaos champions (Chaotic Reflection, which inflicts a random hex-like
          effect on itself and the target, and Random Bolt as per the rod
          of destruction);
        - warmongers (Grand Avatar, essentially a hybrid battlesphere and
          spectral weapon which triggers on sufficiently damaging attacks of
          nearby allies, and Sap Magic, a hex which hinders spellcasting success
          progressively as spells are cast);
        - corrupters (Plane Rend, which summons high tier enemies from other
          branches, and Corrupt Body, which inflicts a small set of temporary
          mutations);
        - black suns (Black Mark, which empowers nearby allies with various
          draining attacks that heal on hit, and previously existing spells
          Bolt of Draining, Malign Offering, and Dispel Undead).
* Adjustments to lair branch enemies:
    - Spriggan druids' Druid's Call now calls 2-3 creatures out of LOS nearby
      and does not invisibly might creatures; instead, nearby creatures
      are healed and frenzied on their death. Stone Arrow also replaces
      Sunray in their spell set.
    - Siren songs' pulling effects are now irresistible if the player is
      already mesmerised.
    - Siren songs call drowned souls, weak temporary enemies with a drowning
      attack.

      moving until a few turns is spent doing nothing to remove them.
    - Harpies no longer steal food or eat food off of the ground.
    - Plain salamanders have been weakened, and all salamanders can slither
      around on land.

    - Boggarts are more durable.
    - Rakshasas gain a monster spell "Phantom Mirror", which summons
      a clone of a nearby allied monster with half the hit points, with
      a 50% chance of swapping the clone for the original; this replaces
      their previous self-cloning abilities. They can now also cast
      Iskenderun's Mystic Blast and will summon two clones of themselves
      at 50% HP as a one-time effect.
    - Giant orange brains get Mass Confusion instead of Confusion.
    - Spriggans in general now merely have fast movement speed instead of
      fast speed in general, more damage and less EV.
    - Spriggan air mages have Haste (replacing Shock).

      demons.
    - Draconian knights have fewer but distinct spell sets focusing on
      ice and necromancy.

      Magma respectively, and generate with mace-type weapons.
    - Metal gargoyles are now war gargoyles - fast and with the ability to
      fire metal fragments at targets.
    - Crystal golems are now crystal guardians - less health, but with the
      ability to fire crystal bolts that bounce off of all walls and deal
      either fire or cold damage on a per-bolt basis.
    - Ravens and eldritch tentacles no longer eat corpses.
* New uniques:
    - Asterion, a minotaur of Makhleb who flings Major Destruction and
      can employ Spectral Weapon with his demon weapon;
    - Natasha, a felid ex-familiar with minor spellcasting abilities;
    - Vashnia, leader of a squad of naga sharpshooters with translocational
      ability to match.
* Moths of suppression, rock worms, lava fish, lemures, jellyfish, grey rats,
  spiny worms, giant amoebae, deep dwarf berserkers, agate snails, giant
  centipedes, rotting devils, clay golems, and stone golems are no more.
* Ball lightnings are no longer permanently confused, instead seeking out
  targets like giant spores.
* Killer Klowns have a different set of possible damage brands: strong
  poison, pain, drain speed, fire, cold, electric, and anti-magic.
* Flying enemies are no longer immune to throwing nets.
* Geryon can fly once again.
* Antaeus gains Flash Freeze, an ice conjuration which impedes the target's
  movement for three turns.

  a confusion effect against the player.
* All pandemonium lords now see invisible.
* The Enchantress now appears as a normal unique in the Depths.

  Draining, and Animate Dead - and rN+++.

  general the target will be to enchant, rather than how well or how poorly
  they fared on that particular resistance roll.

      spire up to two squares away from the player; it replaces Summon

      that protects the player with Injury Bond and occasionally explodes
      on death; appears in the book of Callings.

      and temporarily converts terrain near the player to forest; it

    - Forceful Dismissal (L6 Summoning), which ends all player summons
      and damages enemies next to them; it appears in the Grand Grimoire.

      abjuration effect; it replaces Mass Abjuration in the Grand Grimoire.
    - Spellforged Servitor (L7 Conjuration/Summoning), which summons a
      servitor with a subset of the player's most destructive conjurations;
      it replaces Fireball in the book of Wizardry.

      dragons near targets at the end of LOS (at the full spell cost per

  resistances and the ability to fly at XL14.
* Sludge elves are no more.
* The Skald background gets a reworked spellbook with four new spells:

      killed (of sufficient threat level);

    - Phantasmal warriors can temporarily reduce their target's magic
      resistance and can blink closer to their foes.

      ghost is killed and/or enough time passes.

      full randomly-generated monsters, coming with a band of skeletal
      warriors 50% of the time.

      higher HD and HP; they also come with a band of vampires.

      capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm
      undead and occasionally summon spectral things.

      undead creatures or assume the shape of a nearby killed living
      creature; they can be summoned by deep elf death mages.

* Jory now spawns normally in the late dungeon, instead of being limited to
  vaults.

    - Orange demons' sting has a 50% chance of inflicting a Weakness status,
      which reduces the player's attack damage.
    - Blue devils have a swooping attack, where they can immediately move
      adjacent to the player and attack from up to four tiles away.

      now-guaranteed polearms' reaching attacks.

* Updated spell set for several monsters:
    - Draconian shifters:

        - A new monster spell: Dimension Anchor, which temporarily prevents
          teleportation, blinking, and Phase Shift.

        - Drop Swiftness.

        - Banishment is banished.
        - Gains Dimension Anchor (see draconian shifter entry above), Strip

          Confusion.
    - Curse toes:
        - No more Summon Undead.

          removed.

Spells
------

  - Searing Ray, a level 2 conjuration replacing Force Lance in the
    Book of Conjurations that deals damage over several consecutive turns.
  - Discord, a level 8 hex that attempts to frenzy all monsters in sight.

  has a fixed numerical limit for the number of summons active at any time.
  Going over this limit means your oldest summons will expire in a very
  short number of turns. Applies only to non-necromantic non-permanent
  summons.

      rubble to fall from nearby rock, stone, or permarock walls to damage
      creatures adjacent to them, and has a chance to shaft creatures;

    - Has a fixed, random number of charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
    - 1/3 chance to fail on usage with no bad effects.
    - When successful, generates a chimera; a new monster with three heads.
      Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which provides

      the attacks and abilities available to the monster.

* The lantern of shadows' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations,
  and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.
* New unrand: the +4 moon troll leather armour {Spirit MP+5 Regen}.
* Adjustments to unrands:
   - Arga is now a broad axe.
   - The shield of the gong no longer has guardian spirit; it is otherwise
     unchanged.
   - The knife of accuracy and boots of the Assassin are no more.
   - The lightning scales are now +6 (was +3).

--------------------------

0.12 highlights
---------------
* Axes have a cleaving attack, hitting up to 7 enemies around you.
* The Vaults branch is five levels deep, with a distinct layout and several new
  types of guards.
* Abyss has multiple levels of increasing difficulty, more varied terrain, and
  many new thematic monsters.
* Conjurers get a new starting book of offensive non-elemental spells.
* Beogh and Yredelemnul let you recall allies across dungeon levels.
* Major changes to Vehumet.
* Friendly summons no longer attack out of sight.
* Secret doors are no more.

Branches, environment
---------------------
* The Hall of Blades layout has been adjusted, and now contains two weapons
  with "interesting brands" instead of just one.
* The Abyss is revamped yet again. It now contains five (still infinite)
  levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with
  different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The rune
  appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper levels.
* The Abyssal rune always appears in a vault, never lying around on the floor.
* Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss exits.
* Many Ziggurat floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few monster
  sets have been replaced entirely.
* Three new Sprint maps: "Thunderdome" by evilmike, "The Pits" and "Arena of
  Blood" both by st.
* The Abyss no longer exists in Sprint.
* New layouts for Cocytus, Gehenna, Snake, and the main Dungeon.
* More layouts allowed in Zot.
* New Lair branch ending vaults, and many other new vaults.
* More decorative vaults are now placed.
* "Special rooms" (kobold/orc rooms, beehives, morgues, jelly pits) have been
  adjusted, now appear at more appropriate depths and layouts, and no longer
  place doors.
* A new "special room" - the mythical zoo, with standard high fantasy beasts.
* New "runed door" feature: won't be opened by auto-explore or by monsters.
  Becomes a regular door when opened.
* Alarm traps only trigger once, but make monsters swarm towards you for some
  time.

Character
---------
* Stalker is removed.
* Berserkers may choose their starting weapon.
* Gladiator no longer starts with a buckler, gets more Dodging to compensate.
* Traps are spotted (or not) deterministically based on skill level and a
  few other factors: spending more time does not help.
* Levitation and controlled flight are no more - all flight is controlled.
* Flying no longer increases carrying capacity.
* Tengu receive their movement speed bonus when flying, regardless of burden.
* Black draconians gain permanent flight (like Tengu but without the speed
  boost) at XL 14.
* Removed the hidden special cost of Spellcasting, Stealth, Evocations and
  Invocations. Aptitudes adjusted.
* Experience aptitude uses the same scale as skill aptitudes. This scale is
  coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or less
  experience to gain levels than before.
* Deep Elves are better at Earth magic than Air.
* Hill Orcs are better at Axes, worse at gaining levels.
* Tengu are better at gaining levels.
* Levels 1 and 2 of the teleportitis mutation teleport you only a limited
  distance.

  weapon.

    - Tentacled starspawn: has constricting tentacles and a nasty attack.
    - Ancient zyme: causes sickness when near the player.

      Has a smite-targeted psychic scream that becomes more powerful as
      more masses become visible.
    - Apocalypse crab: breathes clouds of chaos.
    - Thrashing horror: moves like a bat, tramples, and frenzies.
    - Spatial maelstrom: incorporeal vortex that turns walls into spatial
      vortices.
* New deep troll specialist monsters, appearing in late-D deep troll packs:
    - Deep troll shamans: cast Might Other and Haste Other on their
      accompanying deep troll packs.
    - Deep troll earth mages: cast Dig and LRD to allow the rest of the deep
      troll pack to pursue their opponent.
* New vaults monsters:
    - Vault sentinels, with a signal horn that generates a lot of noise and
      the Sentinel's Mark spell which alerts all creatures on the level to
      the player's location.
    - Vault wardens, with the ability to close and seal doors near the player
      for a time or until they are killed.
    - Ironbrand convokers, with the ability to recall other monsters on the
      level to their location. Also cast Might Other.

  Invisible and Insulation.
* New spells:
    - Force Lance (level 2 Conjuration). Fires a short-range single-target
      projectile that can knock monsters backwards.
    - Dazzling Spray (level 3 Conjuration/Hexes). Fires a spread of energy
      bolts that can blind creatures.
    - Iskenderun's Battlesphere (level 4 Conjuration/Charms). Creates an
      autonomous globe that shoots at enemies in sync with your conjurations.
    - Fulminant Prism (level 5 Conjuration/Hexes). Creates a time bomb at a
      smite-targeted location.

Items
-----
* Axes have a cleaving attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single
  swing (all directions except directly opposite the direction of attack,
  but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75%
  damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is reduced
  to compensate.
* One-handed maces and flails have been improved: flails and eveningstars get
  a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1 damage/accuracy
  boost to replace spiked flails.
* The wand of polymorph other is now the wand of polymorph; use of it against
  the player will turn them into a random form (including several new forms -
  tree form, wisp form, porcupine form and fungus form).
* Scroll of unholy creation is replaced with scroll of summoning, which
  summons a few level-appropriate monsters.
* Removed items: spiked flail, potion of water, staff of enchantment, plain
  (non-magic, non-quarter-) staves

* Potions and rings of levitation are now "of flight"; boots of levitation

* Amulet of clarity prevents mesmerisation.
* Some rods were changed to have a more focused spell set.
* The "Contam" artefact property no longer causes contamination over time,
  but only when the item is unequipped.
* The "*Rage" artefact property triggers much less often (except for Wrath of
  Trog).
* Improved fixedarts: Spear of the Botono, Robe of Night, Cloak of the Thief,
  Robe of Folly, plutonium sword.
* The hand-and-a-half weapon category is gone; such weapons are now
  one-handed for normal-size races.

  levels.

  animate your weapon at all anymore.

* Player action counts and generated vaults are now included in dumps by
  default.
* List options can be prepended to with ^=.
* The "evil_eating" and "evil_item" menu-colouring prefixes are renamed to
  "forbidden".
* Explosion and cloud spells will try to target a spot adjacent to an
  out-of-range monster before falling back to the player's position,
  but will ignore plants.
