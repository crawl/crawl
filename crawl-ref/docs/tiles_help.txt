                     wininit.txt description

After Crawl has been run in tiles mode, it will create a wininit.txt file,
which stores several configurable parameters.  This is separate from the
standard init.txt file, as it can be modified at run-time via the Ctrl+V
command.

The contents of this file look like this:

-- SNIP --
Tile:DngnX=19
Tile:DngnY=17
Tile:MapPx=4
Tile:MsgX=77
Tile:MsgY=10
Tile:WindowTop=145
Tile:WindowLeft=22
Tile:FontName=8x13
Tile:FontSize=12
-- SNIP --

The above values are typical Unix settings.  On Windows, the font name will be
something like "Courier".  If you wish to modify this file manually, here are
what these parameters refer to:

DngnX, DngnY               Size (in tiles) of the dungeon region.
MapPx                      Width (in pixels) per square of the minimap.
MsgX, MsgY                 Size (in characters) of the message region.
WindowTop, WindowLeft      Location (in pixels) of the Crawl window.
FontName                   Name of the font. 
FontSize                   Size (in pixels) of the font.
