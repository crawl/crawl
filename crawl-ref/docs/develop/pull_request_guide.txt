How to Pull Request
===================

The following is a rough guide on how to issue a pull request via
github.  It is meant to make merging patches easier for developers
but does not guarantee a patch will be accepted - that depends on
content.

Required tools
--------------

A github account
Forked copy of crawl

Suggested to make life easier
-----------------------------

Local clone of your forked crawl
SSH interaction with github

Patching process
----------------

1.) Switch to master branch:
    git checkout master

2.) Create an appropriately named branch:
    git branch This_is_the_name

3.) Switch to that branch:
    git checkout This_is_the_name

4.) Make the code changes in editors

5.) Commit your changes and comment accordingly, include mantis link:
    git commit -a

6.) Push the changes to your github fork:
    git push

7.) Create a pull request:
    On github open your fork of crawl and refresh.  Click on 'branches'
    and you see your branches under 'Your Branches' with a button to
    the right 'New Pull Request' to click when ready.

Other things
------------

If a mistake is made and the pull request needs to be modified, use the
following steps:

1.) Switch to the branch needing editing:
    git checkout This_is_the_name

2.) Rebase:
    git rebase -i HEAD^

3.) Edit the 'pick' to an 'r' on the line of the specific commit

4.) Change code as needed

5.) Push the code:
    git push --force
