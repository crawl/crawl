Before we get to modding species in my set of tutorials, we need to
cover mutations and abilities first. All of a species innate abilities
are handled by mutations. Some grant stat changes, others grant
abilities, but they all use the same framework.

We start off as before, by editing enum.h to add the entry for our new
mutation. This time, we're updating mutation_data.h in the same way,
putting our new entry right above the NUM_MUTATIONS magic entry. Note
that if you're adding multiple mutations (or anything, really) it
doesn't matter which order they get added in, as long as they don't
replace the spot any existing mutation had.

    #if TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
        MUT_STURDY_FRAME,
        MUT_SANGUINE_ARMOUR,
    #endif
    MUT_LASER_EYES, //first new entry
    MUT_PREHENSILE_BEARD, //second new entry
    NUM_MUTATIONS,
    RANDOM_MUTATION,

There's more special cases for mutations below RANDOM_MUTATION than we
saw for jobs, but those are for code that adds or removes mutations in
play. We aren't concerned with those now.

The second place we'll handle code is mutation-data.h. Much less happens
here than in other structs of similar purpose, but it's similarly nicely
documented. Most of the actual work for mutations is checked in the
relevant part of the code elsewhere in the game. This mostly handles how
many levels your mutation has and the text for them.

    struct mutation_def
    {
        mutation_type mutation;
        short       weight;     ///< Commonality of the mutation;
                                /// bigger = appears more often.
        short       levels;     ///< The number of levels of the mutation.
        mutflags    uses;       ///< Bitfield holding types of effects that
                                ///  grant this mutation (mutflag::*)
        bool        form_based; ///< Mutation is suppressed when shapechanged.
        const char* short_desc; ///< What appears on the '%' screen.
        const char* have[3];    ///< What appears on the 'A' screen.
        const char* gain[3];    ///< Message when you gain the mutation.
        const char* lose[3];    ///< Message when you lose the mutation.
    };

Again, copy and paste an existing one to minimize mistakes in structure:

    { MUT_LASER_EYES, 2, 2, mutflag::GOOD, false,
      "laser eyes",

      {"You can shoot laser beams from your eyes.",
       "You can shoot BIGGER laser beams from your eyes.",
       ""},

      {"Your eyes burn with power.",
       "Your burning eyes intensify."
       ""},

      {"Your eyes feel refreshed and cease burning.",
       "Your eyes relax and burn less.",
       ""},
    },

    { MUT_PREHENSILE_BEARD, 1, 1, mutflag::GOOD, false,
      "prehensile beard",

      {"Your beard can move around on its own.",
       "",
       ""},

      {"Your beard gains a will of its own.",
      ""
      ""},

      {"Your beard shaves itself off in shame.",
       "",
       ""},
    },

We're going to have the laser eyes mutation be an activateable ability,
and prehensile beard will be yet another off-hand attack passive power.
These aren't fantastically clever mutations, but they'll illustrate how
to implement your own.

We can look at the naga's spit poison ability as the closest thing in
place to our laser eyes power. We'll search for that mutation's name
[MUT_SPIT_POISON] and we see that it's checked in ability.cc,
mutation.cc, and tags.cc outside of the mutation and species definition
blocks. Lucky for us, tsgs.cc is for save file compatibility across
versions, so we can ignore it for our new mutations. Were we editing
levels of an existing mutation, we might want to update tags.cc as well
to handle saves to keep them in line with the current range of levels.

For our laser eyes active ability, we need add an entry in enum.h again,
this time to the ability_type enum. This list is nicely organized right
now, but we should add our entry to the end right before NUM_ABILITIES
to minimize any possible save compatibility issue. I'll skip cutting and
pasting yet another block of code, but our name is ABIL_LASER_EYES.

Next, in ability.cc, we find that there's an array called Ability_List[].
The entries in it aren't sorted the same as the enum, but that's ok.
We'll still add a new entry to the bottom. The actual entries follow
this struct:

    // Structure for representing an ability:
    struct ability_def
    {
        ability_type     ability;
        const char *     name;
        unsigned int     mp_cost;        // magic cost of ability
        scaling_cost     hp_cost;        // hit point cost of ability
        unsigned int     food_cost;      // + rand2avg(food_cost, 2)
        generic_cost     piety_cost;     // + random2((piety_cost + 1) / 2 + 1)
        failure_info     failure;        // calculator for failure odds
        ability_flags    flags;          // used for additional cost notices
    };

Here we see there's 2 different random rolls involving different costs,
2 static costs that won't change, and flags for other costs. Let's add
our own, similar to ABIL_SPIT_POISON:

    { ABIL_LASER_EYES, "Shoot Eye Lasers",
        1, 0, 50, 0, {FAIL_XL, 20, 1}, abflag::NONE },

This ability will cost us about 50 food and 1 MP to use, and the success
chance is only attached to our character level, not any skill. Farther
down, in, the _do_ability function, we see the master switch() statement
that handles ability use. We'll add ours in here, and order does not
matter for this one, so we'll place it by similiar abilities instead of
at the end:

    case ABIL_LASER_EYES:      // eye lasers
    {
        int power = 25 + (you.experience_level * 2 * player_mutation_level(MUT_LASER_EYES);
        beam.range = _calc_breath_ability_range(abil.ability);

        if (player_mutation_level(MUT_MISSING_EYE) //Ru - Sacrifice an Eye
            power = power / 2; //only get half power if you only have half as many eyes.

        if (player_mutation_level(MUT_EYEBALLS)) // Jiyva mutation.
            power = power * 4; //if you're all eyes, you're also all eye-lasers!

        if (!spell_direction(abild, beam)
            || !player_tracer(ZAP_DISINTEGRATE, power, beam))
        {
            return SPRET_ABORT;
        }
        else
        {
            fail_check();
            zapping(ZAP_DISINTEGRATE, power, beam);
        }
        break;
    }

In this case, I'm being lazy and using an existing spell for my laser
eyes' effect, and the casting power gets slightly stronger every level,
and doubles if I have 2 levels instead of 1. I could create a new spell,
and a new zap_type entry to match it, but that's another post.

You may also want to update the your_talents() or find_ability_slot()
blocks of ability.cc to set the letter for your ability if it should
have its own static letter. We won't this time, so laser eyes will
simply go in the next open letter slot for the character. In addition,
we also need to add an entry to _calc_breath_ability_range() for our
ranged ability.

    case ABIL_BREATHE_STEAM:        return 6;
    case ABIL_SPIT_POISON:          return 5;
    case ABIL_BREATHE_POISON:       return 6;
    case ABIL_LASER_EYES:           return 7; //7 is max for Line of
                                              //Sight, so that's how far
                                              //our eyes can work.

If you have an ability that might not always be possible to activate
(like a breath weapon, or stopping flight over deep water), you need to
go to _check_ability_possible() and add a check there. Laser eyes
shouldn't have any such conditions. We may also need to add the ability
as a talent (yet another term, this one means 'activateable ability' as
I've been using it here) in the your_talents function like so:

    if (player_mutation_level(MUT_LASER_EYES) > 0)
        _add_talent(talents, ABIL_LASER_EYES, check_confused);

You can do all sorts of complicated checks here, and the vampire part
should be a good example of how complex you might want to get at worst.
Note that deity-granted talents will be added automatically, and don't
appear in this block of code. We could also edit find_ability_slot() if
we wanted to assign a set letter to our ability, but I don't currently
want to do that for a randomly acquired mutation.

That should be all of the required steps for an active ability.

Now, let's look at our passive power, prehensile beard. Again, this is a
1-level copy of the horns/hooves/beak/etc mutations for demonstration
purposes, so we can search for MUT_HORNS and see it gets checked in
itemuse.cc, melee_attack.cc, mutation.cc, tiledoll.cc, and transform.cc
in addition to the files we handled at the beginning.

transform.cc handles gaining MUT_HORNS via the Beastly Appendage spell,
so we won't need to copy that part. All of the mutation.cc entries
involve conflicting mutations and gear slots, and the item-use.cc
entires stop you from equipping gear that won't fit over horns. This is
worth taking a look at, especially if you want to do similar body mods
like new scale mutations, or blade-hands, or something else that should
replace a piece of gear. We'll assume that beards can be tucked through
the facemask or bottom of a helmet and won't conflict with equipment.
tiledoll.cc handles the player character's tile icon in tiles mode. We
should update that to be a good citizen, but I don't want to worry about
the complexity of displaying a layered icon correctly in this tutorial.

That leaves melee_attack.cc as where the meat of the mutation goes. The
good news is that we can make a copy of already frequently implemented
code. First let's copy this auxilliary attack class and modify it, then
make an instance of our new class, and then check for our new attack
along with the other auxilliary attacks:

    //CREATE THIS:
    class AuxBeard: public AuxAttackType
    {
    public:
        AuxBeard()
        : AuxAttackType(9, "beard-slap") { }; //base damage, then display name.

        int get_damage() const override
        {
            //dwarven beards are just as strong as their dwarf in many cases.
            return damage + you.species == SP_DEEP_DWARF ? 20 : 1;
        }
    };

    //ALSO CREATE THIS
    static const AuxBeard        AUX_BEARD = AuxBeard();

    //UPDATE BOTTOM OF THIS LIST
    static const AuxAttackType* const aux_attack_types[] =
    {
        &AUX_CONSTRICT,
        &AUX_KICK,
        &AUX_HEADBUTT,
        &AUX_PECK,
        &AUX_TAILSLAP,
        &AUX_PUNCH,
        &AUX_BITE,
        &AUX_PSEUDOPODS,
        &AUX_TENTACLES,
        &AUX_BEARD,
    };

    //ADD A CASE TO THIS FUNCTION:
    bool melee_attack::_extra_aux_attack(unarmed_attack_type atk)
    {
        if (atk != UNAT_CONSTRICT
            && you.strength() + you.dex() <= random2(50))
        {
            return false;
        }

        switch (atk)
        {
        case UNAT_CONSTRICT:
            return player_mutation_level(MUT_CONSTRICTING_TAIL)
                    || you.species == SP_OCTOPODE && you.has_usable_tentacle();

        case UNAT_BEARD:
            return player_mutation_level(MUT_PREHENSILE_BEARD)
        //REST OF THE FUNCTION TRIMMED FOR SPACE

Now we have to go back to melee_attack.h and add in the new UNAT_BEARD
enum entry to unarmed_attack_type, since we didn't see that until
etting to the code above (also note, this enum is NOT in enums.h like
every other one so far):

    enum unarmed_attack_type
    {
        UNAT_NO_ATTACK,                    //    0
        UNAT_CONSTRICT,  // put constriction first so octopodes will use it
        UNAT_KICK,
        UNAT_HEADBUTT,
        UNAT_PECK,
        UNAT_TAILSLAP,
        UNAT_PUNCH,
        UNAT_BITE,
        UNAT_PSEUDOPODS,
        UNAT_TENTACLES,
        UNAT_BEARD,
        UNAT_FIRST_ATTACK = UNAT_CONSTRICT,
        UNAT_LAST_ATTACK = UNAT_BEARD, //we had to update this now because
                                       //we replaced the last attack. Still
                                       //stay before NUM_UNARMED_ATTACKS
        NUM_UNARMED_ATTACKS,
    };

...and that should do it. Compile, and you should have a small chance
for a character to gain laser eyes or an off-hand attack with a beard
when mutating. Other flags can mark your mutation as being usable
exclusively by a deity.

Your mutations can do pretty much anything, so your own new mutations
might be much more complicated than these examples are. There are enough
current mutations that you most likely will have a good starting place
by looking at an existing mutation and making small changes to it. The
most complexity comes from when a mutation gets referenced on something
else, like how our beard ended up needed a new class to work correctly.

Summary Notes:
   - enum.h for mutation_type entry (and ability entries if applicable)
   - mutation-data.h to fill in the basics of the mutation.
   - mutation.cc for any conflicting mutations or mutations sharing the
     same 'slot'.
   - ability.cc for mutations that have an activatable component (talents).
   - mutations can affect stuff in almost any other file, depending on
     what your mutation changes. Our example changed melee_attack.cc.
   - check for your mutation using
     "player_mutation_level(MUT_NAME_HERE) > 0"
     as a simple check when getting creative with your code.
