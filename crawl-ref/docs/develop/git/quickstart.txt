Subject: [Crawl-ref-discuss] git quickstart

This is for those who haven't used git before and need a
crash-course on basic operations. I'll keep this as simple as
possible, and focus specifically on crawl-ref, rather than git in
general. I've also added links to the official git docs at the end,
which you can read instead of, or in addition to this, if you're
inclined.

Installing git
--------------
I strongly recommend using at least git 1.6 or later. While you can
use older versions, the newer versions are much more user-friendly.
This guide assumes you're using 1.6.

Linux: Install git using your package manager. The git package is
usually called git-core.

Mac: Install git using Mac ports or Fink. The MacPorts port is
called git-core (sudo port install git-core).

Windows: Install msysgit (http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/).
TortoiseGit is apparently pretty usable now for those who want
Windows explorer integration, but I have not used it myself.

Using git for crawl-ref
-----------------------

0. Basic git settings:

   Set your name for git to use when committing changes:
   $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"

   Set your email address:
   $ git config --global user.email "jdoe@users.sourceforge.net"

   This assumes that you're using git only for crawl-ref on SF, and
   you don't mind making your SF id your default email id for all
   git work. If you're already using git for other things, you don't
   need this crash-course anyway. :P

1. Clone the crawl-ref repository (analogous to svn checkout):

   Developers (anyone with commit rights to the git repo):
   $ git clone ssh://<sfid>@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref

   Example:
   $ git clone ssh://dploog@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref

   When prompted for your password, enter your Sourceforge password.

   Other users:
   $ git clone git://crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref

   "git clone" clones the SF crawl-ref git repository to your
   machine. When it's done, you have a full local copy of the
   crawl-ref repository with all its history.

2. Sanity-check your cloned repository (optional):

   When you come back to a git repository after a while, you may not
   recall where you cloned it from. You can check with:

   $ git remote -v

   For me, this reports:
   origin  ssh://dshaligram@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref
(fetch)
   origin  ssh://dshaligram@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref
(push)

   See all available branches in the repository:
   $ git branch -a

   See all tags:
   $ git tag

3. Updating your repository with the latest changes from SF:

   Use
   $ git pull
   to grab the latest commits from Sourceforge.

   git pull assumes your working tree is clean; it will refuse to
   overwrite any files that you've modified locally (unlike svn's
   "svn update", which will happily try to modify the file anyway,
   and add conflict markers if there are conflicts).

   If git pull fails because you have local changes, you have two
   options:

   1. Complete your local changes and create a commit, then pull
      again.

   2. Temporarily save (stash) your local changes, pull changes from
      SF, and reapply your local changes:
      $ git stash
      (this saves your local changes)
      $ git pull
      (grab changes from SF)
      $ git stash apply
      (reinstate your local changes)

      If your local changes conflict with the changes from SF, git
      stash apply will warn you of the conflict and add conflict
      markers to the relevant files.

4. Committing a change to the 'master' branch:

   git's master branch is the equivalent of svn trunk. Immediately
   after cloning a repository, the cloned crawl-ref repo will be on
   the master branch. You can check what branch you're working on at
   any time with:

   $ git branch

   The active branch will be asterisked.

   Before starting work, let's make sure our working copy is not
   dirty:

   $ git status
   # On branch master
   nothing to commit (working directory clean)

   Looking good. For our first change, let's assume we're fixing a
   bug in, say, stuff.cc.

   $ vim stuff.cc
   <hackhackhack>
   $ make
   <test; that bugfix rocks the world>

   Let's check how git sees things now:
   $ git status
   # On branch master
   # Changed but not updated:
   #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
   #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
   #
   #       modified:   stuff.cc
   #
   no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

   git sees that we've modified stuff.cc. You can see what changes
   you've made with:

   $ git diff

   Time to actually commit the change:
   $ git commit -a

   git will bring up your preferred editor for you to enter your
   commit message. On Windows, you may have to set your EDITOR
   environment variable; alternatively, you can specify your commit
   message on the command line:

   $ git commit -a -m "Fitted stuff.cc with warp drive"

   When you're done, your change has been committed to your local
   repository. Let's try git status again:

   $ git status
   # On branch master
   # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
   #
   nothing to commit (working directory clean)

   So git's telling us that we have one local commit that we haven't
   sent to Sourceforge's git repository yet. Let's send in our fix
   to SF (core devs only):

   $ git push

   You will be prompted for your password again. git should then
   push your commit, producing a last line that looks like:

   54ea5f1..ec2e15e  master -> master

   The exact commit ids will differ, but a successful push looks
   like this. Your push may fail if someone has pushed changes to SF
   already (git will warn you about a non-fast-forward). In this
   case, just pull and push again:

   $ git pull
   $ git push

5. Viewing revision history:

   You can see a history of changes with
   $ git log

   git log by itself may make it appear that the change history is a
   straight line, but we know that git can handle branching
   histories. We can request that git log show us the branching
   history with:

   $ git log --graph

   You can also view history using the gitk GUI (this is installed
   by default; everyone should have it, and I recommend it):

   $ gitk

   The history commands normally show you the history of the current
   branch, but you can view other branches/tags' histories by naming
   the branch or tag:

   $ gitk origin/stone_soup-0.2
   $ gitk release-0.5.1

   If you want to annotate a file with last author and commit to
   change each line in the file, you can use git blame, which is
   similar to svn blame:

   $ git blame stuff.cc

6. Committing a change to the 0.5 branch:

   So far we've restricted our attention to 'master', which is the
   easiest branch to work with, since it's selected by default. Now
   let's say we have a bug report with a 0.5.1 save, and we need the
   0.5 code to test the save with:

   Let's take a look at the branches we have locally:
   $ git branch
   * master

   The only local branch in our repository is master. Let's look at
   the branches in the remote repository (SF):
   $ git branch -r
     origin/HEAD -> origin/master
     origin/master
     origin/stone_soup
     origin/stone_soup-0.1.3
     origin/stone_soup-0.1.4
     origin/stone_soup-0.1.5
     origin/stone_soup-0.1.6
     origin/stone_soup-0.1.7
     origin/stone_soup-0.2
     origin/stone_soup-0.3
     origin/stone_soup-0.4
     origin/stone_soup-0.5

   So our local repository has a "master" branch corresponding to SF's
   "master" branch. We do not yet have a branch corresponding to SF's
   "stone_soup-0.5", so let's create the branch and switch to it:

   $ git checkout -b stone_soup-0.5 origin/stone_soup-0.5
   Branch stone_soup-0.5 set up to track remote branch stone_soup-0.5
from origin.
   Switched to a new branch 'stone_soup-0.5'

   master and stone_soup-0.5 are both local branches now:
   $ git branch
     master
   * stone_soup-0.5

   git status will also confirm that we're on 0.5 now:
   $ git status
   # On branch stone_soup-0.5
   nothing to commit (working directory clean)

   A quick peek at the history to make really sure we're on 0.5:
   $ git log

   To grab the latest changes for 0.5:
   $ git pull

   Ok, now we compile 0.5, test the 0.5 save and verify that a bug
   exists. Once we've fixed the bug, we create a commit:
   $ git commit -a

   Check git status:
   $ git status
   # On branch stone_soup-0.5
   # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/stone_soup-0.5' by 1 commit.
   #
   nothing to commit (working directory clean)

   Right, we're ready to push our fix to SF. But now that we have
   multiple local branches, let's first ask git what it plans to do
   when we push:

   $ git push --dry-run -v
   Pushing to ssh://dshaligram@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref
   To ssh://dshaligram@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref
    = [up to date]      master -> master
      b05bb66..976e722  stone_soup-0.5 -> stone_soup-0.5

   So git wants to push the local master and stone_soup-0.5 branches
   to the corresponding branches on SF; the master branch has no new
   local changes, whereas the 0.5 branch does (the new change is
   976e722).

   By default, git-push will push *all* your local branches to the
   corresponding branches on Sourceforge. This is important to
   remember; if you had local commits on master, they would also be
   pushed to SF. This behaviour can be changed (the option is called
   "push.default") if it bothers you.

   Once you're done working on 0.5, you can switch back to "master"
   with:
   $ git checkout master

   The next time you need to work on 0.5 again, you can return to it
   with:
   $ git checkout stone_soup-0.5

7. SSH keys (for SF developers):

   If you've been following along with the examples, you've probably
   noticed that all the password prompts when you push or pull from SF
   are wearing on your patience (this does not apply to users who've
   cloned using the git:// URL).

   svn handles the problem of needing passwords all the time by
   caching the credentials you use the first time you enter them
   (for https:// WebDAV svn access; svn does not cache credentials
   for svn+ssh). git does not cache credentials.

   To save yourself the pain of entering your password each time, you
   should create an ssh key and upload your public key to SF:

   Let's create an ssh key (if you already have a key, skip this
   step):
   $ ssh-keygen

   You can accept all the default options and use an empty passphrase
   for convenience (don't do this on an account you share with other
   people, or they can commit to crawl-ref too :P)

   Once the key is generated, you'll have two files id_rsa, and
   id_rsa.pub in your ~/.ssh (the .ssh directory in your home
   directory). id_rsa is your private key, and should not be shared or
   given to anyone else (or they can pretend to be you); id_rsa.pub is
   your public key, and this is what you'll upload to Sourceforge.

   Go to SF, login, and hit the "Account" link to access your account
   settings.

   Under "Account", click the "Services" tab, and select "Edit SSH
   keys for Shell/CVS".

   Copy the one line in your id_rsa.pub, and paste it into the
   Authorized keys text area. Hit Update when you're done.

   Sourceforge being awesome, it will make silly choking noises even
   on valid ssh keys:

   "Our key validator reports that there may be a problem with one or
   more of the lines of key data you provided; please edit your SSH
   keys for Shell/CVS to see which lines may be invalid."

   Ignore these cries of "Wolf! Wolf!"

   Within a few minutes of uploading your key, you should be able to
   push/pull from SF without needing to reenter your password.

   Windows users (msysgit) can follow these exact same steps in a git
   bash prompt.

   You can also create a DSA key instead of an RSA key (or use an
   existing DSA key). SF accepts both.


8. Common operations:

   Reverting Changes
   -----------------
   It often happens that you make a change to a file that you didn't
   want, or accidentally delete files that you did want. You can
   revert a file to its pristine version as:

   $ git checkout stuff.cc

   This also works to bring back files you accidentally deleted. If
   you forget these commands, "git status" will remind you:

   $ git status
   # On branch master
   # Changed but not updated:
   #   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
   #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
   #
   #       deleted:    mt19937ar.cc
   #
   no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

   Adding New Files
   ----------------
   When committing changes with "git commit -a", newly created files
   won't be added to the commit unless you request it with "git add".
   Let's take an example:

   $ git status
   # On branch master
   # Untracked files:
   #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
   #
   #       dwim.cc
   nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

   Before we commit, we must add the new file:
   $ git add dwim.cc
   $ git status
   # On branch master
   # Changes to be committed:
   #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
   #
   #       new file:   dwim.cc

   $ git commit -a

   In general, "git status" is your friend. It will usually tell you
   exactly what you need to do.

9. Branching:

   Let's say it's time to create a stable 0.6 branch. Here's how you'd
   do it:

   a) Branch 0.6 from master:
      $ git checkout -b stone_soup-0.6 master

      Let's check our local branches now:
        master
        stone_soup-0.5
      * stone_soup-0.6

      stone_soup-0.6 is currently a *local* branch. SF's git repo
      doesn't have it yet.

   b) Push the local branch to SF with a --dry-run first to make sure
      we're not lousing up anything:

      $ git push --dry-run -v origin stone_soup-0.6
      Pushing to
ssh://dshaligram@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref
      To ssh://dshaligram@crawl-ref.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crawl-ref/crawl-ref
       * [new branch]      stone_soup-0.6 -> stone_soup-0.6

      Now for the real push:
      $ git push origin stone_soup-0.6

   c) Point your local branch at the new branch in SF:

      Now that we've created the branch on SF, we want to set up our
      local "stone_soup-0.6" to get changes from SF's "stone_soup-0.6"
      when we do a git pull. We do this as:

      Tell git that stone_soup-0.6's remote repository is on SF:
      $ git config branch.stone_soup-0.6.remote origin

      And that the corresponding branch in SF is stone_soup-0.6:
      $ git config branch.stone_soup-0.6.merge refs/heads/stone_soup-0.6

      Now you can pull changes from SF's 0.6 branch:
      $ git pull

      This is only necessary for new branches that you create locally
      and push to SF. This configuration is automatically set up for
      you when you work with branches that already exist on SF.

10. Tagging:

   Once 0.6 is fit for a release, you'll need to tag it:

   $ git checkout stone_soup-0.6
   $ git tag -a release-0.6 -m "0.6: Now with extra kangaroos"

11. Committing changes from one major branch of development to another:

   Once we create a stable branch (say 0.5), we usually make all
   changes to trunk, but apply bugfixes to the 0.5 branch as well.
   You can apply changes from master to stone_soup-0.5 with git
   cherry-pick:

   $ git checkout master
   [ make the changes for the bugfix ]
   $ git commit -a
   $ git checkout stone_soup-0.5

   And cherry-pick the tip commit of the master branch (the bugfix
   we just committed there):
   $ git cherry-pick master

   If the commit you want to cherry-pick is not the tip of a branch, just
   use the commit's id:
   $ git cherry-pick b0ed1449

   git push will then send in the commits from both branches.

I've intentionally kept my examples very simple and glossed over a
lot of details. I've covered the common operations in the svn
workflow, but git can do much more for you if you spend a little
time learning it.

There's another way of specifying where to push:

git push <remote> <local branch>:<remote branch>

So for instance, if I am working on 'master' locally, but want to push
to a remote branch called 'fixes-for-upstream', I could do:

git push github master:fixes-for-upstream
