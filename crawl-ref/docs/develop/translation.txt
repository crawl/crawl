Guide to translating and improving Crawl's text
===============================================

Text Improvement
================

If you would like to help translate DCSS, first fork the main branch,
then make edits in there. Once you are done translating, create a pull
request and it will likely be accepted! Don't worry if you only translate
one entry, every little bit is appreciated! If you want to submit changes
to the English text, use the files in crawl-ref/source/dat/descript
for this, otherwise, change the files inside the corresponding language
folder in the descript folder (es for Spanish, de for German, etc.).
{{ and }} can be used to include lua code, for example to change the
description of the floor depending on which branch the player is in.
Use "return" to return the description if you use Lua code.
Quotes use smart quote unicode characters (U+8220 and U+8221).

Formatting
==========

Use %%%% to seperate each entry, then write the (English) name of
the thing you want to edit. Add a line of spacing, then write the
(translated) description of the thing.

Examples:

%%%%
A rock wall    (English name)

Una pared de rocca sencilla.   (This is the translation)
%%%%    (Add these between entries)
The floor

{{ //Lua code goes in here
local descript = "El piso." //declare a **local** variable to store the description
    if player_in_branch(BRANCH_DUNGEON) then
        descript = descript .. " Est√° hecho de roca lisa." //concatenate extra flavour depending on the branch
    elseif player_in_branch(BRANCH_TEMPLE) then
        descript = descript .. " Hay musgo entredadera creciendo en lo."
    end
    return descript //don't forget to return!
}}
%%%%

See some of the translated files for more examples.



Quotes
======

Don't translate quotes; instead, submit quotes in their original language. It's
allowed to submit translated text, especially for things like biblical
references, but don't forget to include information about the translator.
Not all entries have a quote associated with them.

Aliases
=======

If you want to use the same text for several keys, you can use <key_name> to
avoid duplicating the string.
