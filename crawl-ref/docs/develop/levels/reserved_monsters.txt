Reserved monsters list
======================

It is notably unlikely for future submissions for main game vaults to be
accepted if they deploy the following monsters outside of their current natural
branch appearances or Ziggurats. There are some wrinkles to this:
 - Branch entrance vaults may make exceptions only within the Vestibule of Hell.
 - Sprints, being outside the main game, may freely mix this up as they see fit.
 - A handful of exceptions outside of these rules may persist, primarily in
   Wizlabs, and have mostly been grandfathered in.

Monster usage in vaults may also be rejected for any of many reasons outside of
this list, such as being significantly out-of-depth in threat in practice, or
using spell components outside of spells or decorative glass cages.

This list is sorted by branch usage, rather than by individual monsters:

-- Vaults --
 * Ironbound preservers, ironbound convokers, ironbound mechanists,
   ironbound beastmasters, ironbound frosthearts, ironbound thunderhulks,
   vault wardens.
  * Exceptions granted to Ice Caves for ironbound frosthearts.

-- Abyss --
 * Ancient zymes, lurking horrors, spatial maelstroms, starflowers, wretched
   stars.

-- Pandemonium --
 * Nekomata.

-- Gehenna --
 * Creeping infernos, stokers, searing wretches.
  * Exceptions granted to Margery's band for searing wretches.

-- Cocytus --
 * Wendigo.

-- Tartarus --
 * Tainted leviathans, putrid mouths, oblivion hounds.
  * Exceptions granted to Grunn's band for oblivion hounds.

-- The Iron City of Dis --
 * Iron giants, iron golems, quicksilver elementals.

-- Tomb --
 * Bennu.

-- Zot --
 * Death cobs, killer klowns, orbs of fire, orbs of winter, orbs of entropy,
   orb guardians.
  * Orb guardians are even more exclusive to Zot:5 and the orb run.

-- Other cases --
 * Protean progenitors may only appear in Zot or the domain of Mnoleg.
 * Seraphim should not be deployed outside of the current extended Holy
   encompass vault.
 * Hell sentinels should not be deployed earlier than Abyss, the Hells,
   Pandemonium, or the orb run.
 * The following monsters are essentially player species dummies that should
   only be deployed as decoration behind glass or corpses rather than as enemies
   to fight in-and-of themselves: armataurs, barachi, demigods, djinn,
   colourless draconians, dwarves, felids, formicids, octopodes, oni,
   poltergeists, revenants, and vine stalkers.

This document may be expanded in the future with other notes about branch
identity preservation, such as not emphasizing elves in Depths, not using
walking tomes in the Vaults, not using spriggans in Zot, and minimizing crossing
over monsters between each Lair branch roulette branch.
