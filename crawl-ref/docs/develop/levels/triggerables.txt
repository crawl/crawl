This document describes the usage of Triggerables, a modular, extensible and
highly flexible Lua marker system used for making vaults. For more general
syntax and other advanced Lua topics, see introduction.txt, syntax.txt and
advanced.txt.

A.   Introduction
=================

Triggerables are an event-driven framework that can be used to further randomise
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup maps, specifically at runtime. They can be used in
every-day minivaults, portal vaults, branch endings and more.

You've probably already used Triggerables in vaults, or seen them in action:
FogMachines are a randomised Triggerable, while many altar and trap vaults use
Triggerables to take some action when the player comes into view or steps on a
specific square. These often-used Triggerables may be wrapped in convenience
functions (see section D).

However, Triggerables can be combined with pre-defined Lua functions to achieve
extremely complicated game mechanics: in the "Collapsing Caverns" Volcano vault,
they are used to randomly close cave entrances, while in the "Overflow" Volcano
vault, they are used to increase and decrease the amount of lava present.

Triggerables are usually only limited by the amount of triggers (see
the list in section E), and Lua wrappers available. As these are constantly
increasing, you are really only limited by imagination and vault design ethics.

Sections B and C cover customised Triggerables (using examples from the Volcano
portal vaults), while section D covers convenience functions (using examples
from Branch ends).

B.   Sample syntax
==================

Customised Triggerers usually use the non-abstracted TriggerableFunction
mechanic. Consider this (trimmed) example from the Volcano portal vault (see
dat/volcano.des for the full vault):

-----------------------------

{{
-- Function in .des file prelude:
function callback.collapse_doorways (data, triggerable, triggerer, marker, ev)
  if triggerer.type ~= "turn" or triggerer.sub_type ~= "countdown" then
    return
  end

  [Doorway collapse code]

  -- Don't collapse same doorway twice.
  triggerable:remove(marker)
end
}}

{{
-- Code in the actual vault:
local collapse_marker = TriggerableFunction:new (
  {
    func="callback.collapse_doorways",
    repeated=true,
    props = {
      -- Only collapse one doorway at a time, randomly.
      single_random_slave="true"
    }
  }
)

collapse_marker:add_triggerer(DgnTriggerer:new {
  type="turn",
  delay_min=50,
  delay_max=200
})

}}

-----------------------------

As you can see, a TriggerableFunction consists of three parts: firstly, the
function that is to be triggered, which is provided five parameters:

  * data, a pre-defined Lua table which can be used for persistent data storage.
  * triggerable, the instance of the Triggerable that is triggering the
        function.
  * triggerer, the instance of the DgnTriggerer that has fired
  * marker, the marker object
  * ev, the event object

In most instances, the used parameters are "data", "triggerer" and "marker". The
first of these allows for the storage of any function-required data persistently
(such as the number of doorways already collapsed, the number of doorways left
to collapse, etc).

Note that the function to be triggered must be defined as a global
function in the .des file prelude (or in a .lua file in dat/dlua that
is required() by the .des file prelude), and that the function must be
specified by its global name.

"Triggerer" is regularly used in randomised functions to determine whether or
not the function is actually being fired. For example, if the Triggerer is not
of the "turns" type and "countdown" subtype; see the WarningMachines in
dat/dlua/lm_fog.lua for examples of functions being triggered randomly, and
being triggered a certain number of turns before a FogMachine is fired).

Finally, "marker" is usually used to determine the position of the Triggerable
by colling the "marker:pos()" function.

-----------------------------

The second part of the TriggerableFunction is the actual marker. In this case,
it is an instance of TriggerableFunction, called via TriggerableFunction:new.
This requires the "func" parameter, the name of the function that is to be
called.

It also optionally takes the following parameters: "repeated" which defaults to
'false': a non-repeated Triggerable will be removed after its first firing, and
will not be subsequently fired.

"props". A table consisting of one or more properties. In this instance takes
the "single_random_slave" parameter, which is linked into Master and Slave
mechanics (see Section F).

"data". A table consisting of data used by the function. This defaults to a
blank table, but can be specified with on creation of the marker. (See the
"Overflow" Volcano map in dat/volcano.des).

-----------------------------

The third and final part of the Triggerable is the actual trigger itself: this
is an instance of DgnTriggerer, and is added to the marker with the
"add_triggerer" function. See section E, "List of triggerers" for more
information.

-----------------------------

In our example, all of this combined creates a Triggerable which does the
following (ignoring the master/slave mechanics):

1. Randomly every "50" and "200" "turns"[1]
2. Pick a random slave
3. Trigger the function "collapse_doorways" at the slave
4. Remove the triggerer from that slave.

This is repeated until all of the triggerers have been removed, or the player
leaves the level.

[1]: "Turns" are a misnomer. The countdown operates off the value of ev:ticks(),
     a value which may be, but is not always, "10" for every turn. In practise,
     for randomised functions, you can times your values by 10 to roughly get
     a "turns" value: therefore, "50" ~= every 5 turns, "200" ~= every 20 turns.

The following section will provide some annotated examples of customised
TriggerableFunctions.

C. Examples of usage
====================

These vaults were taken in whole from the crawl code repository, and several
have been updated or removed since their original inclusion. Please see the
referenced files for the current version.

D. Convenience functions
========================

Previously, we have discussed completely customised Triggerables, using the
TriggerableFunction marker. There also exist a large variety of other markers
and convenience functions which use Triggerables as a base.

Markers which use Triggerables as a base include FogMachines, MonsterOnTrigger,
feat_change_change_flags, item_pickup_change_flags, and so on. These are
documented in their own individual files.

Currently, convenience functions for Triggerables include:

  * message_at_spot, which can be used to trigger a single or repeated message
      whenever the player crosses or reaches a certain point.
  * function_at_spot, as above, but accepts a function and data parameter
      instead of message and channel.

E.    List of triggerers
========================

This list taken from dat/dlua/lm_trig.lua, listing the different "type"
parameters that an instance of DgnTriggerer may accept, and the required
parameters for each.

   * monster_dies: Waits for a monster to die. Needs the parameter
         "target", who's value is the name of the monster who's death
         we're wating for. Doesn't matter where the triggerable/marker
         is placed.
   * feat_change: Waits for a cell's feature to change. Accepts the
         optional parameter "target", which if set delays the trigger
         until the feature the cell turns into contains the target as a
         substring. The triggerable/marker must be placed on top of the
         cell who's feature you wish to monitor.
   * item_moved: Wait for an item to move from one cell to another.
        Needs the parameter "target", who's value is the name of the
        item that is being tracked, or which can be "auto", in which
        case it will pick the item placed by the vault. The
        triggerable/marker must be placed on top of the cell containing
        the item.
   * item_pickup: Wait for an item to be picked up. Needs the parameter
        "target", who's value is the name of the item that is being tracked,
        or which can be "auto", in which case it will pick the item placed
        by the vault. The triggerable/marker must be placed on top of the
        cell containing the item. Automatically takes care of the item
        moving from one square to another without being picked up.
   * player_move: Wait for the player to move to a cell. The
        triggerable/marker must be placed on top of cell in question.
   * player_los: Wait for the player to come into LOS of a cell, which
        must contain a notable feature. The triggerable/marker must be
        placed on top of cell in question.
   * turn: Called once for each player turn that passes. Optionally accepts a
        "delay_min", "delay_max" or "delay" parameters, in which case a
        countdown is performed.
   * entered_level: Called when player enters the level, after all level
        setup code has completed.

F.     Master and slaves
========================

Multiple Triggerables can be combined together in a master/slave setup. There
are multiple methods of doing this. The simplest is to provide a
"master_name" parameter to the main marker, and then provide "slave_to" at all
of the individual slave markers, setting the same value for each.

When a Triggerable is fired and it has a "master_name" property, it will execute
at each of the slave locations as defined above, unless the master has the
parameter "single_random_slave" (set to anything but empty), in which case it
will randomly chose one slave and execute there. Further, the master marker may
be slaved to itself in order to have execution occur there.

Triggerables that depend on position (such as player_move) will only fire when
the player moves over the master marker. For them to fire at either slave or
master, provide the "listen_to_slaves" property. Finally, to have only the slave
that fired be executed, provide the "only_at_slave" parameter.

-----------------------------

An example from dat/hells.des, using the MonsterOnTriggerer marker, a subset of
Triggerables, and master/slave mechanics:

MARKER:  1 = lua:monster_on_death { \
            death_monster="Dispater", new_monster="generate_awake iron golem", \
            message_seen="The iron statue comes to life!", \
            message_unseen="You hear a grinding sound.", \
            master_name="dispater" \
         }
MARKER:  o = lua:props_marker { \
            veto_fragmentation="veto", veto_disintegrate="veto", \
            slaved_to="dispater" \
         }

-----------------------------

If you have any comments, questions, or issues with Triggerables, your best bet
would be to contact the crawl-ref-discuss mailing list on SourceForge, or to try
##crawl-dev on irc.freenode.org.
