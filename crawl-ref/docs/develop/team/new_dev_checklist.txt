This is a checklist for integrating a new developer into the team.

 * Commit rights: add their GitHub account to the DCSS group.
 * Add them to .mailmap (in the repository root) and CREDITS.txt.
 * Upgrade their Mantis account to developer.
 * Update the wiki listing:
        https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:admin:devteam
 * Add them to the committer group on IRC:
        /msg chanserv access ##crawl-dev add NICK committer
   They should first register with NickServ (/msg nickserv help register) to
   prevent others from using that nick.  /whois NICK  will show an "account"
   field if they are registered.
 * Upgrade their Crawl server accounts (CAO, CDO, et al) to administrator. This
   lets them use wizmode, and on CAO and CSZO gives them access to save backups
   and the rebuild trigger:
        dgl admin add <username>
 * Create a WordPress account for them.
 * On the Tavern, add them to the Dungeon Master group.
 * Subscribe their email address to C-R-D:
        https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/crawl-ref-discuss
 * Ask advil or |amethyst to add them to the private mailing list.
 * Send an announcement/welcome message on C-R-D.
