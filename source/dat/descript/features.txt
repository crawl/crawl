enough to step on it. You may find yourself thrown into the Abyss, contaminated

dungeon may even trigger it themselves to invoke its effects against you.

### Clouds
### TODO: move this to its own file!
############
flame cloud

A cloud of raging fire. Any creature not entirely immune to fire will be hurt
by time spent in the flames, though armour can mitigate the damage.

Ranged cold attacks are blocked by the cloud, but will destroy it in the
process.

If placed over water, the heat will generate steam nearby. If the water is deep
enough, the cold of the waves will lead to the cloud dissipating much more
quickly.
%%%%
noxious fumes cloud

A cloud of vile, choking fumes. Any breathing creature spending time in it will
be at risk of becoming dazed & confused by the gasses, unless equipped with
some source of poison resistance. Tougher, more experienced creatures are less
likely to be affected.
%%%%
freezing vapour cloud

A cloud of freezing air. Any creature not entirely immune to cold will be hurt
by time spent inside, though armour can mitigate the damage.

Ranged fire and lava attacks are blocked by the cloud, but will destroy it in
the process.

If placed over lava, the heat will dissipate the cloud much more quickly.
%%%%
poison gas cloud

A cloud of deadly poison. Any creature without resistance to poison will be
both poisoned & directly harmed by time spent in it.
%%%%
smoke cloud

A cloud of coloured smoke. Harmless, except to the asthmatic.
%%%%
black smoke cloud

<smoke cloud>
%%%%
grey smoke cloud

<smoke cloud>
%%%%
blue smoke cloud

<smoke cloud>
%%%%
purple smoke cloud

<smoke cloud>
%%%%
translocational energy cloud

The remnant of some creature that was recently here but is no longer, banished
nearby, across the level, or out of reality itself, all the way into the Abyss.
Some wizards say these are a kind of "allergic reaction" the universe
produces, in response to magic that warps space in impossible ways; a cosmic
sneeze. Perhaps metaphysically gross, but otherwise harmless.
%%%%
spreading flames cloud

A raging forest fire. Any creature not entirely immune to fire will be hurt by
time spent in the flames, though armour can mitigate the damage.

These flames are especially fierce, and will intermittently flare up and fill
its surroundings with lesser fires. Any trees unfortunate enough to be nearby
will often find themselves transformed into more kindling for the fire.

Ranged cold attacks are blocked by the cloud, but will destroy it in the
process.

If placed over water, the heat will generate steam nearby. If the water is deep
enough, the cold of the waves will lead to the cloud dissipating much more
quickly.
%%%%
steam cloud

A cloud of scalding steam. Creatures caught within will be somewhat injured,
though a modicum of armour or fire resistance is generally enough to reduce the
damage to tolerable levels.
%%%%
ink cloud

A cloud of ink, completely filling the water.
%%%%
calcifying dust cloud

A petrifying cloud. Creatures caught in the cloud for any length of time will
find themselves turning to stone, though an experienced adventurer can often
resist the effects.
%%%%
blessed fire cloud

A cloud of divine fire, imbued with the power & wrath of the good gods. Those
in their service recieve some protection; otherwise, the only defense is stout
armour and the wisdom to not enter the clouds in the first place. Those
following evil gods are especially well advised to avoid these clouds, and the
undead and demonic are even moreso.
%%%%
foul pestilence cloud

# XXX: clarify vine stalkers, gargoyles
A cloud of dark miasma. Any living being not subject to Zin's divine protection
will find themselves terribly poisoned, ignoring any resistance they may have
to lesser toxins. The unfortunate may find their movements slowing & their
flesh rotting away, if they dally. Even the dumbest denizens of the Dungeon
will avoid miasma if they can, and adventurers are well advised to do the same.
%%%%
thin mist cloud

Atmospheric, but harmless.
%%%%
seething chaos cloud

Reality itself become unhinged. A variety of exciting effects apply to those
dallying within the clouds, ranging from invisibility to berserk rage to
complete paralysis. The wise adventurer will stay to experience as few of these
as possible.
%%%%
rain cloud

An extremely localized rainstorm. Sometime produces pools of shallow water, or
temporarily deepens existing pools. Beings made entirely out of fire are
inexplicably averse to spending much time in these.

If placed over lava, the heat will dissipate the cloud much more quickly.
%%%%
mutagenic fog cloud

Pure, unstructured magic, condensed into a scintilliating mist; essentially,
toxic magical waste. Creatures venturing within will find soon themselves
glowing in the dark, and generally acquire a variety of exciting mutations
shortly afterward. Not the fun kind, either!
%%%%
magical condensation cloud

The wake of some highly concentrated magical energy. Harmless. (But whatever
spawned it probably isn't!)
%%%%
raging winds cloud

The winds of a raging tornado. Stout armour will mitigate the worst of the
damage, but tarrying in here is still a good way to meet a quick death.
%%%%
sparse dust cloud

Atmospheric, but harmless.
%%%%
ghostly flame cloud

The memory of flames past. Neither resistance to fire nor negative energy
protect against these clouds; only armour will suffice. Luckily, standing in
them causes very little harm. The spectres that emerge from the flames, on the
other hand, are considerably more dangerous...
%%%%
acidic fog cloud

A cloud of flesh-searing, metal-dissolving acid. Resistance to corrosion will
mitigate the damage, as will armour, but the latter will quickly be eaten away
by the acid. Very few creatures can survive in this for long.
%%%%
thunder cloud

A lightning-spitting storm. The lightning only comes intermittently, but when
it does, it hurts!
%%%%
negative energy cloud

A cloud of necromantic magics. Living creatures trapped within will find
themselves drained of their life energies, though armour and protection from
negative energies mitigate the effects.
